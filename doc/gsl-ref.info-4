35 Multidimensional Root-Finding
********************************

This chapter describes functions for multidimensional root-finding
(solving nonlinear systems with n equations in n unknowns).  The library
provides low level components for a variety of iterative solvers and
convergence tests.  These can be combined by the user to achieve the
desired solution, with full access to the intermediate steps of the
iteration.  Each class of methods uses the same framework, so that you
can switch between solvers at runtime without needing to recompile your
program.  Each instance of a solver keeps track of its own state,
allowing the solvers to be used in multi-threaded programs.  The solvers
are based on the original Fortran library MINPACK.

   The header file 'gsl_multiroots.h' contains prototypes for the
multidimensional root finding functions and related declarations.

35.1 Overview
=============

The problem of multidimensional root finding requires the simultaneous
solution of n equations, f_i, in n variables, x_i,

     f_i (x_1, ..., x_n) = 0    for i = 1 ... n.

In general there are no bracketing methods available for n dimensional
systems, and no way of knowing whether any solutions exist.  All
algorithms proceed from an initial guess using a variant of the Newton
iteration,

     x -> x' = x - J^{-1} f(x)

where x, f are vector quantities and J is the Jacobian matrix J_{ij} = d
f_i / d x_j.  Additional strategies can be used to enlarge the region of
convergence.  These include requiring a decrease in the norm |f| on each
step proposed by Newton's method, or taking steepest-descent steps in
the direction of the negative gradient of |f|.

   Several root-finding algorithms are available within a single
framework.  The user provides a high-level driver for the algorithms,
and the library provides the individual functions necessary for each of
the steps.  There are three main phases of the iteration.  The steps
are,

   * initialize solver state, S, for algorithm T

   * update S using the iteration T

   * test S for convergence, and repeat iteration if necessary

The evaluation of the Jacobian matrix can be problematic, either because
programming the derivatives is intractable or because computation of the
n^2 terms of the matrix becomes too expensive.  For these reasons the
algorithms provided by the library are divided into two classes
according to whether the derivatives are available or not.

   The state for solvers with an analytic Jacobian matrix is held in a
'gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver' struct.  The updating procedure requires both
the function and its derivatives to be supplied by the user.

   The state for solvers which do not use an analytic Jacobian matrix is
held in a 'gsl_multiroot_fsolver' struct.  The updating procedure uses
only function evaluations (not derivatives).  The algorithms estimate
the matrix J or J^{-1} by approximate methods.

35.2 Initializing the Solver
============================

The following functions initialize a multidimensional solver, either
with or without derivatives.  The solver itself depends only on the
dimension of the problem and the algorithm and can be reused for
different problems.

 -- Function: gsl_multiroot_fsolver * gsl_multiroot_fsolver_alloc (const
          gsl_multiroot_fsolver_type * T, size_t N)
     This function returns a pointer to a newly allocated instance of a
     solver of type T for a system of N dimensions.  For example, the
     following code creates an instance of a hybrid solver, to solve a
     3-dimensional system of equations.

          const gsl_multiroot_fsolver_type * T
              = gsl_multiroot_fsolver_hybrid;
          gsl_multiroot_fsolver * s
              = gsl_multiroot_fsolver_alloc (T, 3);

     If there is insufficient memory to create the solver then the
     function returns a null pointer and the error handler is invoked
     with an error code of 'GSL_ENOMEM'.

 -- Function: gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver * gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_alloc
          (const gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_type * T, size_t N)
     This function returns a pointer to a newly allocated instance of a
     derivative solver of type T for a system of N dimensions.  For
     example, the following code creates an instance of a Newton-Raphson
     solver, for a 2-dimensional system of equations.

          const gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_type * T
              = gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_newton;
          gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver * s =
              gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_alloc (T, 2);

     If there is insufficient memory to create the solver then the
     function returns a null pointer and the error handler is invoked
     with an error code of 'GSL_ENOMEM'.

 -- Function: int gsl_multiroot_fsolver_set (gsl_multiroot_fsolver * S,
          gsl_multiroot_function * F, const gsl_vector * X)
 -- Function: int gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_set (gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver *
          S, gsl_multiroot_function_fdf * FDF, const gsl_vector * X)
     These functions set, or reset, an existing solver S to use the
     function F or function and derivative FDF, and the initial guess X.
     Note that the initial position is copied from X, this argument is
     not modified by subsequent iterations.

 -- Function: void gsl_multiroot_fsolver_free (gsl_multiroot_fsolver *
          S)
 -- Function: void gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_free (gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver
          * S)
     These functions free all the memory associated with the solver S.

 -- Function: const char * gsl_multiroot_fsolver_name (const
          gsl_multiroot_fsolver * S)
 -- Function: const char * gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_name (const
          gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver * S)
     These functions return a pointer to the name of the solver.  For
     example,

          printf ("s is a '%s' solver\n",
                  gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_name (s));

     would print something like 's is a 'newton' solver'.

35.3 Providing the function to solve
====================================

You must provide n functions of n variables for the root finders to
operate on.  In order to allow for general parameters the functions are
defined by the following data types:

 -- Data Type: gsl_multiroot_function
     This data type defines a general system of functions with
     parameters.

     'int (* f) (const gsl_vector * X, void * PARAMS, gsl_vector * F)'
          this function should store the vector result f(x,params) in F
          for argument X and parameters PARAMS, returning an appropriate
          error code if the function cannot be computed.

     'size_t n'
          the dimension of the system, i.e.  the number of components of
          the vectors X and F.

     'void * params'
          a pointer to the parameters of the function.

Here is an example using Powell's test function,

     f_1(x) = A x_0 x_1 - 1,
     f_2(x) = exp(-x_0) + exp(-x_1) - (1 + 1/A)

with A = 10^4.  The following code defines a 'gsl_multiroot_function'
system 'F' which you could pass to a solver:

     struct powell_params { double A; };

     int
     powell (gsl_vector * x, void * p, gsl_vector * f) {
        struct powell_params * params
          = (struct powell_params *)p;
        const double A = (params->A);
        const double x0 = gsl_vector_get(x,0);
        const double x1 = gsl_vector_get(x,1);

        gsl_vector_set (f, 0, A * x0 * x1 - 1);
        gsl_vector_set (f, 1, (exp(-x0) + exp(-x1)
                               - (1.0 + 1.0/A)));
        return GSL_SUCCESS
     }

     gsl_multiroot_function F;
     struct powell_params params = { 10000.0 };

     F.f = &powell;
     F.n = 2;
     F.params = &params;

 -- Data Type: gsl_multiroot_function_fdf
     This data type defines a general system of functions with
     parameters and the corresponding Jacobian matrix of derivatives,

     'int (* f) (const gsl_vector * X, void * PARAMS, gsl_vector * F)'
          this function should store the vector result f(x,params) in F
          for argument X and parameters PARAMS, returning an appropriate
          error code if the function cannot be computed.

     'int (* df) (const gsl_vector * X, void * PARAMS, gsl_matrix * J)'
          this function should store the N-by-N matrix result J_ij = d
          f_i(x,params) / d x_j in J for argument X and parameters
          PARAMS, returning an appropriate error code if the function
          cannot be computed.

     'int (* fdf) (const gsl_vector * X, void * PARAMS, gsl_vector * F, gsl_matrix * J)'
          This function should set the values of the F and J as above,
          for arguments X and parameters PARAMS.  This function provides
          an optimization of the separate functions for f(x) and
          J(x)--it is always faster to compute the function and its
          derivative at the same time.

     'size_t n'
          the dimension of the system, i.e.  the number of components of
          the vectors X and F.

     'void * params'
          a pointer to the parameters of the function.

The example of Powell's test function defined above can be extended to
include analytic derivatives using the following code,

     int
     powell_df (gsl_vector * x, void * p, gsl_matrix * J)
     {
        struct powell_params * params
          = (struct powell_params *)p;
        const double A = (params->A);
        const double x0 = gsl_vector_get(x,0);
        const double x1 = gsl_vector_get(x,1);
        gsl_matrix_set (J, 0, 0, A * x1);
        gsl_matrix_set (J, 0, 1, A * x0);
        gsl_matrix_set (J, 1, 0, -exp(-x0));
        gsl_matrix_set (J, 1, 1, -exp(-x1));
        return GSL_SUCCESS
     }

     int
     powell_fdf (gsl_vector * x, void * p,
                 gsl_matrix * f, gsl_matrix * J) {
        struct powell_params * params
          = (struct powell_params *)p;
        const double A = (params->A);
        const double x0 = gsl_vector_get(x,0);
        const double x1 = gsl_vector_get(x,1);

        const double u0 = exp(-x0);
        const double u1 = exp(-x1);

        gsl_vector_set (f, 0, A * x0 * x1 - 1);
        gsl_vector_set (f, 1, u0 + u1 - (1 + 1/A));

        gsl_matrix_set (J, 0, 0, A * x1);
        gsl_matrix_set (J, 0, 1, A * x0);
        gsl_matrix_set (J, 1, 0, -u0);
        gsl_matrix_set (J, 1, 1, -u1);
        return GSL_SUCCESS
     }

     gsl_multiroot_function_fdf FDF;

     FDF.f = &powell_f;
     FDF.df = &powell_df;
     FDF.fdf = &powell_fdf;
     FDF.n = 2;
     FDF.params = 0;

Note that the function 'powell_fdf' is able to reuse existing terms from
the function when calculating the Jacobian, thus saving time.

35.4 Iteration
==============

The following functions drive the iteration of each algorithm.  Each
function performs one iteration to update the state of any solver of the
corresponding type.  The same functions work for all solvers so that
different methods can be substituted at runtime without modifications to
the code.

 -- Function: int gsl_multiroot_fsolver_iterate (gsl_multiroot_fsolver *
          S)
 -- Function: int gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_iterate
          (gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver * S)
     These functions perform a single iteration of the solver S.  If the
     iteration encounters an unexpected problem then an error code will
     be returned,

     'GSL_EBADFUNC'
          the iteration encountered a singular point where the function
          or its derivative evaluated to 'Inf' or 'NaN'.

     'GSL_ENOPROG'
          the iteration is not making any progress, preventing the
          algorithm from continuing.

   The solver maintains a current best estimate of the root 's->x' and
its function value 's->f' at all times.  This information can be
accessed with the following auxiliary functions,

 -- Function: gsl_vector * gsl_multiroot_fsolver_root (const
          gsl_multiroot_fsolver * S)
 -- Function: gsl_vector * gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_root (const
          gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver * S)
     These functions return the current estimate of the root for the
     solver S, given by 's->x'.

 -- Function: gsl_vector * gsl_multiroot_fsolver_f (const
          gsl_multiroot_fsolver * S)
 -- Function: gsl_vector * gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_f (const
          gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver * S)
     These functions return the function value f(x) at the current
     estimate of the root for the solver S, given by 's->f'.

 -- Function: gsl_vector * gsl_multiroot_fsolver_dx (const
          gsl_multiroot_fsolver * S)
 -- Function: gsl_vector * gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_dx (const
          gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver * S)
     These functions return the last step dx taken by the solver S,
     given by 's->dx'.


File: gsl-ref.info,  Node: Search Stopping Parameters for the multidimensional solver,  Next: Algorithms using Derivatives,  Prev: Iteration of the multidimensional solver,  Up: Multidimensional Root-Finding

35.5 Search Stopping Parameters
===============================

A root finding procedure should stop when one of the following
conditions is true:

   * A multidimensional root has been found to within the user-specified
     precision.

   * A user-specified maximum number of iterations has been reached.

   * An error has occurred.

The handling of these conditions is under user control.  The functions
below allow the user to test the precision of the current result in
several standard ways.

 -- Function: int gsl_multiroot_test_delta (const gsl_vector * DX, const
          gsl_vector * X, double EPSABS, double EPSREL)

     This function tests for the convergence of the sequence by
     comparing the last step DX with the absolute error EPSABS and
     relative error EPSREL to the current position X.  The test returns
     'GSL_SUCCESS' if the following condition is achieved,

          |dx_i| < epsabs + epsrel |x_i|

     for each component of X and returns 'GSL_CONTINUE' otherwise.

 -- Function: int gsl_multiroot_test_residual (const gsl_vector * F,
          double EPSABS)
     This function tests the residual value F against the absolute error
     bound EPSABS.  The test returns 'GSL_SUCCESS' if the following
     condition is achieved,

          \sum_i |f_i| < epsabs

     and returns 'GSL_CONTINUE' otherwise.  This criterion is suitable
     for situations where the precise location of the root, x, is
     unimportant provided a value can be found where the residual is
     small enough.

35.6 Algorithms using Derivatives
=================================

The root finding algorithms described in this section make use of both
the function and its derivative.  They require an initial guess for the
location of the root, but there is no absolute guarantee of
convergence--the function must be suitable for this technique and the
initial guess must be sufficiently close to the root for it to work.
When the conditions are satisfied then convergence is quadratic.

 -- Derivative Solver: gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_hybridsj
     This is a modified version of Powell's Hybrid method as implemented
     in the HYBRJ algorithm in MINPACK.  Minpack was written by Jorge J.
     More', Burton S. Garbow and Kenneth E. Hillstrom.  The Hybrid
     algorithm retains the fast convergence of Newton's method but will
     also reduce the residual when Newton's method is unreliable.

     The algorithm uses a generalized trust region to keep each step
     under control.  In order to be accepted a proposed new position x'
     must satisfy the condition |D (x' - x)| < \delta, where D is a
     diagonal scaling matrix and \delta is the size of the trust region.
     The components of D are computed internally, using the column norms
     of the Jacobian to estimate the sensitivity of the residual to each
     component of x.  This improves the behavior of the algorithm for
     badly scaled functions.

     On each iteration the algorithm first determines the standard
     Newton step by solving the system J dx = - f.  If this step falls
     inside the trust region it is used as a trial step in the next
     stage.  If not, the algorithm uses the linear combination of the
     Newton and gradient directions which is predicted to minimize the
     norm of the function while staying inside the trust region,

          dx = - \alpha J^{-1} f(x) - \beta \nabla |f(x)|^2.

     This combination of Newton and gradient directions is referred to
     as a "dogleg step".

     The proposed step is now tested by evaluating the function at the
     resulting point, x'.  If the step reduces the norm of the function
     sufficiently then it is accepted and size of the trust region is
     increased.  If the proposed step fails to improve the solution then
     the size of the trust region is decreased and another trial step is
     computed.

     The speed of the algorithm is increased by computing the changes to
     the Jacobian approximately, using a rank-1 update.  If two
     successive attempts fail to reduce the residual then the full
     Jacobian is recomputed.  The algorithm also monitors the progress
     of the solution and returns an error if several steps fail to make
     any improvement,

     'GSL_ENOPROG'
          the iteration is not making any progress, preventing the
          algorithm from continuing.

     'GSL_ENOPROGJ'
          re-evaluations of the Jacobian indicate that the iteration is
          not making any progress, preventing the algorithm from
          continuing.

 -- Derivative Solver: gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_hybridj
     This algorithm is an unscaled version of 'hybridsj'.  The steps are
     controlled by a spherical trust region |x' - x| < \delta, instead
     of a generalized region.  This can be useful if the generalized
     region estimated by 'hybridsj' is inappropriate.

 -- Derivative Solver: gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_newton

     Newton's Method is the standard root-polishing algorithm.  The
     algorithm begins with an initial guess for the location of the
     solution.  On each iteration a linear approximation to the function
     F is used to estimate the step which will zero all the components
     of the residual.  The iteration is defined by the following
     sequence,

          x -> x' = x - J^{-1} f(x)

     where the Jacobian matrix J is computed from the derivative
     functions provided by F.  The step dx is obtained by solving the
     linear system,

          J dx = - f(x)

     using LU decomposition.  If the Jacobian matrix is singular, an
     error code of 'GSL_EDOM' is returned.

 -- Derivative Solver: gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_gnewton
     This is a modified version of Newton's method which attempts to
     improve global convergence by requiring every step to reduce the
     Euclidean norm of the residual, |f(x)|.  If the Newton step leads
     to an increase in the norm then a reduced step of relative size,

          t = (\sqrt(1 + 6 r) - 1) / (3 r)

     is proposed, with r being the ratio of norms |f(x')|^2/|f(x)|^2.
     This procedure is repeated until a suitable step size is found.

35.7 Algorithms without Derivatives
===================================

The algorithms described in this section do not require any derivative
information to be supplied by the user.  Any derivatives needed are
approximated by finite differences.  Note that if the
finite-differencing step size chosen by these routines is inappropriate,
an explicit user-supplied numerical derivative can always be used with
the algorithms described in the previous section.

 -- Solver: gsl_multiroot_fsolver_hybrids
     This is a version of the Hybrid algorithm which replaces calls to
     the Jacobian function by its finite difference approximation.  The
     finite difference approximation is computed using
     'gsl_multiroots_fdjac' with a relative step size of
     'GSL_SQRT_DBL_EPSILON'.  Note that this step size will not be
     suitable for all problems.

 -- Solver: gsl_multiroot_fsolver_hybrid
     This is a finite difference version of the Hybrid algorithm without
     internal scaling.

 -- Solver: gsl_multiroot_fsolver_dnewton

     The "discrete Newton algorithm" is the simplest method of solving a
     multidimensional system.  It uses the Newton iteration

          x -> x - J^{-1} f(x)

     where the Jacobian matrix J is approximated by taking finite
     differences of the function F.  The approximation scheme used by
     this implementation is,

          J_{ij} = (f_i(x + \delta_j) - f_i(x)) /  \delta_j

     where \delta_j is a step of size \sqrt\epsilon |x_j| with \epsilon
     being the machine precision (\epsilon \approx 2.22 \times 10^-16).
     The order of convergence of Newton's algorithm is quadratic, but
     the finite differences require n^2 function evaluations on each
     iteration.  The algorithm may become unstable if the finite
     differences are not a good approximation to the true derivatives.

 -- Solver: gsl_multiroot_fsolver_broyden

     The "Broyden algorithm" is a version of the discrete Newton
     algorithm which attempts to avoids the expensive update of the
     Jacobian matrix on each iteration.  The changes to the Jacobian are
     also approximated, using a rank-1 update,

          J^{-1} \to J^{-1} - (J^{-1} df - dx) dx^T J^{-1} / dx^T J^{-1} df

     where the vectors dx and df are the changes in x and f.  On the
     first iteration the inverse Jacobian is estimated using finite
     differences, as in the discrete Newton algorithm.

     This approximation gives a fast update but is unreliable if the
     changes are not small, and the estimate of the inverse Jacobian
     becomes worse as time passes.  The algorithm has a tendency to
     become unstable unless it starts close to the root.  The Jacobian
     is refreshed if this instability is detected (consult the source
     for details).

     This algorithm is included only for demonstration purposes, and is
     not recommended for serious use.

35.8 Examples
=============

The multidimensional solvers are used in a similar way to the
one-dimensional root finding algorithms.  This first example
demonstrates the 'hybrids' scaled-hybrid algorithm, which does not
require derivatives.  The program solves the Rosenbrock system of
equations,

     f_1 (x, y) = a (1 - x)
     f_2 (x, y) = b (y - x^2)

with a = 1, b = 10.  The solution of this system lies at (x,y) = (1,1)
in a narrow valley.

   The first stage of the program is to define the system of equations,

     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <gsl/gsl_vector.h>
     #include <gsl/gsl_multiroots.h>

     struct rparams
       {
         double a;
         double b;
       };

     int
     rosenbrock_f (const gsl_vector * x, void *params,
                   gsl_vector * f)
     {
       double a = ((struct rparams *) params)->a;
       double b = ((struct rparams *) params)->b;

       const double x0 = gsl_vector_get (x, 0);
       const double x1 = gsl_vector_get (x, 1);

       const double y0 = a * (1 - x0);
       const double y1 = b * (x1 - x0 * x0);

       gsl_vector_set (f, 0, y0);
       gsl_vector_set (f, 1, y1);

       return GSL_SUCCESS;
     }

The main program begins by creating the function object 'f', with the
arguments '(x,y)' and parameters '(a,b)'.  The solver 's' is initialized
to use this function, with the 'hybrids' method.

     int
     main (void)
     {
       const gsl_multiroot_fsolver_type *T;
       gsl_multiroot_fsolver *s;

       int status;
       size_t i, iter = 0;

       const size_t n = 2;
       struct rparams p = {1.0, 10.0};
       gsl_multiroot_function f = {&rosenbrock_f, n, &p};

       double x_init[2] = {-10.0, -5.0};
       gsl_vector *x = gsl_vector_alloc (n);

       gsl_vector_set (x, 0, x_init[0]);
       gsl_vector_set (x, 1, x_init[1]);

       T = gsl_multiroot_fsolver_hybrids;
       s = gsl_multiroot_fsolver_alloc (T, 2);
       gsl_multiroot_fsolver_set (s, &f, x);

       print_state (iter, s);

       do
         {
           iter++;
           status = gsl_multiroot_fsolver_iterate (s);

           print_state (iter, s);

           if (status)   /* check if solver is stuck */
             break;

           status =
             gsl_multiroot_test_residual (s->f, 1e-7);
         }
       while (status == GSL_CONTINUE && iter < 1000);

       printf ("status = %s\n", gsl_strerror (status));

       gsl_multiroot_fsolver_free (s);
       gsl_vector_free (x);
       return 0;
     }

Note that it is important to check the return status of each solver
step, in case the algorithm becomes stuck.  If an error condition is
detected, indicating that the algorithm cannot proceed, then the error
can be reported to the user, a new starting point chosen or a different
algorithm used.

   The intermediate state of the solution is displayed by the following
function.  The solver state contains the vector 's->x' which is the
current position, and the vector 's->f' with corresponding function
values.

     int
     print_state (size_t iter, gsl_multiroot_fsolver * s)
     {
       printf ("iter = %3u x = % .3f % .3f "
               "f(x) = % .3e % .3e\n",
               iter,
               gsl_vector_get (s->x, 0),
               gsl_vector_get (s->x, 1),
               gsl_vector_get (s->f, 0),
               gsl_vector_get (s->f, 1));
     }

Here are the results of running the program.  The algorithm is started
at (-10,-5) far from the solution.  Since the solution is hidden in a
narrow valley the earliest steps follow the gradient of the function
downhill, in an attempt to reduce the large value of the residual.  Once
the root has been approximately located, on iteration 8, the Newton
behavior takes over and convergence is very rapid.

     iter =  0 x = -10.000  -5.000  f(x) = 1.100e+01 -1.050e+03
     iter =  1 x = -10.000  -5.000  f(x) = 1.100e+01 -1.050e+03
     iter =  2 x =  -3.976  24.827  f(x) = 4.976e+00  9.020e+01
     iter =  3 x =  -3.976  24.827  f(x) = 4.976e+00  9.020e+01
     iter =  4 x =  -3.976  24.827  f(x) = 4.976e+00  9.020e+01
     iter =  5 x =  -1.274  -5.680  f(x) = 2.274e+00 -7.302e+01
     iter =  6 x =  -1.274  -5.680  f(x) = 2.274e+00 -7.302e+01
     iter =  7 x =   0.249   0.298  f(x) = 7.511e-01  2.359e+00
     iter =  8 x =   0.249   0.298  f(x) = 7.511e-01  2.359e+00
     iter =  9 x =   1.000   0.878  f(x) = 1.268e-10 -1.218e+00
     iter = 10 x =   1.000   0.989  f(x) = 1.124e-11 -1.080e-01
     iter = 11 x =   1.000   1.000  f(x) = 0.000e+00  0.000e+00
     status = success

Note that the algorithm does not update the location on every iteration.
Some iterations are used to adjust the trust-region parameter, after
trying a step which was found to be divergent, or to recompute the
Jacobian, when poor convergence behavior is detected.

   The next example program adds derivative information, in order to
accelerate the solution.  There are two derivative functions
'rosenbrock_df' and 'rosenbrock_fdf'.  The latter computes both the
function and its derivative simultaneously.  This allows the
optimization of any common terms.  For simplicity we substitute calls to
the separate 'f' and 'df' functions at this point in the code below.

     int
     rosenbrock_df (const gsl_vector * x, void *params,
                    gsl_matrix * J)
     {
       const double a = ((struct rparams *) params)->a;
       const double b = ((struct rparams *) params)->b;

       const double x0 = gsl_vector_get (x, 0);

       const double df00 = -a;
       const double df01 = 0;
       const double df10 = -2 * b  * x0;
       const double df11 = b;

       gsl_matrix_set (J, 0, 0, df00);
       gsl_matrix_set (J, 0, 1, df01);
       gsl_matrix_set (J, 1, 0, df10);
       gsl_matrix_set (J, 1, 1, df11);

       return GSL_SUCCESS;
     }

     int
     rosenbrock_fdf (const gsl_vector * x, void *params,
                     gsl_vector * f, gsl_matrix * J)
     {
       rosenbrock_f (x, params, f);
       rosenbrock_df (x, params, J);

       return GSL_SUCCESS;
     }

The main program now makes calls to the corresponding 'fdfsolver'
versions of the functions,

     int
     main (void)
     {
       const gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_type *T;
       gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver *s;

       int status;
       size_t i, iter = 0;

       const size_t n = 2;
       struct rparams p = {1.0, 10.0};
       gsl_multiroot_function_fdf f = {&rosenbrock_f,
                                       &rosenbrock_df,
                                       &rosenbrock_fdf,
                                       n, &p};

       double x_init[2] = {-10.0, -5.0};
       gsl_vector *x = gsl_vector_alloc (n);

       gsl_vector_set (x, 0, x_init[0]);
       gsl_vector_set (x, 1, x_init[1]);

       T = gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_gnewton;
       s = gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_alloc (T, n);
       gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_set (s, &f, x);

       print_state (iter, s);

       do
         {
           iter++;

           status = gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_iterate (s);

           print_state (iter, s);

           if (status)
             break;

           status = gsl_multiroot_test_residual (s->f, 1e-7);
         }
       while (status == GSL_CONTINUE && iter < 1000);

       printf ("status = %s\n", gsl_strerror (status));

       gsl_multiroot_fdfsolver_free (s);
       gsl_vector_free (x);
       return 0;
     }

The addition of derivative information to the 'hybrids' solver does not
make any significant difference to its behavior, since it able to
approximate the Jacobian numerically with sufficient accuracy.  To
illustrate the behavior of a different derivative solver we switch to
'gnewton'.  This is a traditional Newton solver with the constraint that
it scales back its step if the full step would lead "uphill".  Here is
the output for the 'gnewton' algorithm,

     iter = 0 x = -10.000  -5.000 f(x) =  1.100e+01 -1.050e+03
     iter = 1 x =  -4.231 -65.317 f(x) =  5.231e+00 -8.321e+02
     iter = 2 x =   1.000 -26.358 f(x) = -8.882e-16 -2.736e+02
     iter = 3 x =   1.000   1.000 f(x) = -2.220e-16 -4.441e-15
     status = success

The convergence is much more rapid, but takes a wide excursion out to
the point (-4.23,-65.3).  This could cause the algorithm to go astray in
a realistic application.  The hybrid algorithm follows the downhill path
to the solution more reliably.

36 Multidimensional Minimization
********************************

This chapter describes routines for finding minima of arbitrary
multidimensional functions.  The library provides low level components
for a variety of iterative minimizers and convergence tests.  These can
be combined by the user to achieve the desired solution, while providing
full access to the intermediate steps of the algorithms.  Each class of
methods uses the same framework, so that you can switch between
minimizers at runtime without needing to recompile your program.  Each
instance of a minimizer keeps track of its own state, allowing the
minimizers to be used in multi-threaded programs.  The minimization
algorithms can be used to maximize a function by inverting its sign.

   The header file 'gsl_multimin.h' contains prototypes for the
minimization functions and related declarations.

36.1 Overview
=============

The problem of multidimensional minimization requires finding a point x
such that the scalar function,

     f(x_1, ..., x_n)

takes a value which is lower than at any neighboring point.  For smooth
functions the gradient g = \nabla f vanishes at the minimum.  In general
there are no bracketing methods available for the minimization of
n-dimensional functions.  The algorithms proceed from an initial guess
using a search algorithm which attempts to move in a downhill direction.

   Algorithms making use of the gradient of the function perform a
one-dimensional line minimisation along this direction until the lowest
point is found to a suitable tolerance.  The search direction is then
updated with local information from the function and its derivatives,
and the whole process repeated until the true n-dimensional minimum is
found.

   Algorithms which do not require the gradient of the function use
different strategies.  For example, the Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm
maintains n+1 trial parameter vectors as the vertices of a n-dimensional
simplex.  On each iteration it tries to improve the worst vertex of the
simplex by geometrical transformations.  The iterations are continued
until the overall size of the simplex has decreased sufficiently.

   Both types of algorithms use a standard framework.  The user provides
a high-level driver for the algorithms, and the library provides the
individual functions necessary for each of the steps.  There are three
main phases of the iteration.  The steps are,

   * initialize minimizer state, S, for algorithm T

   * update S using the iteration T

   * test S for convergence, and repeat iteration if necessary

Each iteration step consists either of an improvement to the
line-minimisation in the current direction or an update to the search
direction itself.  The state for the minimizers is held in a
'gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer' struct or a 'gsl_multimin_fminimizer'
struct.

36.2 Caveats
============

Note that the minimization algorithms can only search for one local
minimum at a time.  When there are several local minima in the search
area, the first minimum to be found will be returned; however it is
difficult to predict which of the minima this will be.  In most cases,
no error will be reported if you try to find a local minimum in an area
where there is more than one.

   It is also important to note that the minimization algorithms find
local minima; there is no way to determine whether a minimum is a global
minimum of the function in question.

36.3 Initializing the Multidimensional Minimizer
================================================

The following function initializes a multidimensional minimizer.  The
minimizer itself depends only on the dimension of the problem and the
algorithm and can be reused for different problems.

 -- Function: gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer *
          gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_alloc (const
          gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_type * T, size_t N)
 -- Function: gsl_multimin_fminimizer * gsl_multimin_fminimizer_alloc
          (const gsl_multimin_fminimizer_type * T, size_t N)
     This function returns a pointer to a newly allocated instance of a
     minimizer of type T for an N-dimension function.  If there is
     insufficient memory to create the minimizer then the function
     returns a null pointer and the error handler is invoked with an
     error code of 'GSL_ENOMEM'.

 -- Function: int gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_set
          (gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer * S, gsl_multimin_function_fdf *
          FDF, const gsl_vector * X, double STEP_SIZE, double TOL)
 -- Function: int gsl_multimin_fminimizer_set (gsl_multimin_fminimizer *
          S, gsl_multimin_function * F, const gsl_vector * X, const
          gsl_vector * STEP_SIZE)
     The function 'gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_set' initializes the
     minimizer S to minimize the function FDF starting from the initial
     point X.  The size of the first trial step is given by STEP_SIZE.
     The accuracy of the line minimization is specified by TOL.  The
     precise meaning of this parameter depends on the method used.
     Typically the line minimization is considered successful if the
     gradient of the function g is orthogonal to the current search
     direction p to a relative accuracy of TOL, where dot(p,g) < tol |p|
     |g|.  A TOL value of 0.1 is suitable for most purposes, since line
     minimization only needs to be carried out approximately.  Note that
     setting TOL to zero will force the use of "exact" line-searches,
     which are extremely expensive.

     The function 'gsl_multimin_fminimizer_set' initializes the
     minimizer S to minimize the function F, starting from the initial
     point X.  The size of the initial trial steps is given in vector
     STEP_SIZE.  The precise meaning of this parameter depends on the
     method used.

 -- Function: void gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_free
          (gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer * S)
 -- Function: void gsl_multimin_fminimizer_free (gsl_multimin_fminimizer
          * S)
     This function frees all the memory associated with the minimizer S.

 -- Function: const char * gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_name (const
          gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer * S)
 -- Function: const char * gsl_multimin_fminimizer_name (const
          gsl_multimin_fminimizer * S)
     This function returns a pointer to the name of the minimizer.  For
     example,

          printf ("s is a '%s' minimizer\n",
                  gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_name (s));

     would print something like 's is a 'conjugate_pr' minimizer'.

36.4 Providing a function to minimize
=====================================

You must provide a parametric function of n variables for the minimizers
to operate on.  You may also need to provide a routine which calculates
the gradient of the function and a third routine which calculates both
the function value and the gradient together.  In order to allow for
general parameters the functions are defined by the following data
types:

 -- Data Type: gsl_multimin_function_fdf
     This data type defines a general function of n variables with
     parameters and the corresponding gradient vector of derivatives,

     'double (* f) (const gsl_vector * X, void * PARAMS)'
          this function should return the result f(x,params) for
          argument X and parameters PARAMS.  If the function cannot be
          computed, an error value of 'GSL_NAN' should be returned.

     'void (* df) (const gsl_vector * X, void * PARAMS, gsl_vector * G)'
          this function should store the N-dimensional gradient g_i = d
          f(x,params) / d x_i in the vector G for argument X and
          parameters PARAMS, returning an appropriate error code if the
          function cannot be computed.

     'void (* fdf) (const gsl_vector * X, void * PARAMS, double * f, gsl_vector * G)'
          This function should set the values of the F and G as above,
          for arguments X and parameters PARAMS.  This function provides
          an optimization of the separate functions for f(x) and
          g(x)--it is always faster to compute the function and its
          derivative at the same time.

     'size_t n'
          the dimension of the system, i.e.  the number of components of
          the vectors X.

     'void * params'
          a pointer to the parameters of the function.
 -- Data Type: gsl_multimin_function
     This data type defines a general function of n variables with
     parameters,

     'double (* f) (const gsl_vector * X, void * PARAMS)'
          this function should return the result f(x,params) for
          argument X and parameters PARAMS.  If the function cannot be
          computed, an error value of 'GSL_NAN' should be returned.

     'size_t n'
          the dimension of the system, i.e.  the number of components of
          the vectors X.

     'void * params'
          a pointer to the parameters of the function.

The following example function defines a simple two-dimensional
paraboloid with five parameters,

     /* Paraboloid centered on (p[0],p[1]), with
        scale factors (p[2],p[3]) and minimum p[4] */

     double
     my_f (const gsl_vector *v, void *params)
     {
       double x, y;
       double *p = (double *)params;

       x = gsl_vector_get(v, 0);
       y = gsl_vector_get(v, 1);

       return p[2] * (x - p[0]) * (x - p[0]) +
                p[3] * (y - p[1]) * (y - p[1]) + p[4];
     }

     /* The gradient of f, df = (df/dx, df/dy). */
     void
     my_df (const gsl_vector *v, void *params,

     {
       double x, y;
       double *p = (double *)params;

       x = gsl_vector_get(v, 0);
       y = gsl_vector_get(v, 1);

       gsl_vector_set(df, 0, 2.0 * p[2] * (x - p[0]));

The function can be initialized using the following code,

36.5 Iteration
==============

The following function drives the iteration of each algorithm.  The
function performs one iteration to update the state of the minimizer.
The same function works for all minimizers so that different methods can
be substituted at runtime without modifications to the code.

 -- Function: int gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_iterate
          (gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer * S)
 -- Function: int gsl_multimin_fminimizer_iterate
          (gsl_multimin_fminimizer * S)
     These functions perform a single iteration of the minimizer S.  If
     the iteration encounters an unexpected problem then an error code
     will be returned.  The error code 'GSL_ENOPROG' signifies that the
     minimizer is unable to improve on its current estimate, either due
     to numerical difficulty or because a genuine local minimum has been
     reached.

The minimizer maintains a current best estimate of the minimum at all
times.  This information can be accessed with the following auxiliary
functions,

 -- Function: gsl_vector * gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_x (const
          gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer * S)
 -- Function: gsl_vector * gsl_multimin_fminimizer_x (const
          gsl_multimin_fminimizer * S)
 -- Function: double gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_minimum (const
          gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer * S)
 -- Function: double gsl_multimin_fminimizer_minimum (const
          gsl_multimin_fminimizer * S)
 -- Function: gsl_vector * gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_gradient (const
          gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer * S)
 -- Function: double gsl_multimin_fminimizer_size (const
          gsl_multimin_fminimizer * S)
     These functions return the current best estimate of the location of
     the minimum, the value of the function at that point, its gradient,
     and minimizer specific characteristic size for the minimizer S.

 -- Function: int gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_restart
          (gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer * S)
     This function resets the minimizer S to use the current point as a
     new starting point.

36.6 Stopping Criteria
======================

A minimization procedure should stop when one of the following
conditions is true:

   * A minimum has been found to within the user-specified precision.

   * A user-specified maximum number of iterations has been reached.

   * An error has occurred.

The handling of these conditions is under user control.  The functions
below allow the user to test the precision of the current result.

 -- Function: int gsl_multimin_test_gradient (const gsl_vector * G,
          double EPSABS)
     This function tests the norm of the gradient G against the absolute
     tolerance EPSABS.  The gradient of a multidimensional function goes
     to zero at a minimum.  The test returns 'GSL_SUCCESS' if the
     following condition is achieved,

          |g| < epsabs

     and returns 'GSL_CONTINUE' otherwise.  A suitable choice of EPSABS
     can be made from the desired accuracy in the function for small
     variations in x.  The relationship between these quantities is
     given by \delta f = g \delta x.

 -- Function: int gsl_multimin_test_size (const double SIZE, double
          EPSABS)
     This function tests the minimizer specific characteristic size (if
     applicable to the used minimizer) against absolute tolerance
     EPSABS.  The test returns 'GSL_SUCCESS' if the size is smaller than
     tolerance, otherwise 'GSL_CONTINUE' is returned.

36.7 Algorithms with Derivatives
================================

There are several minimization methods available.  The best choice of
algorithm depends on the problem.  The algorithms described in this
section use the value of the function and its gradient at each
evaluation point.

 -- Minimizer: gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_conjugate_fr
     This is the Fletcher-Reeves conjugate gradient algorithm.  The
     conjugate gradient algorithm proceeds as a succession of line
     minimizations.  The sequence of search directions is used to build
     up an approximation to the curvature of the function in the
     neighborhood of the minimum.

     An initial search direction P is chosen using the gradient, and
     line minimization is carried out in that direction.  The accuracy
     of the line minimization is specified by the parameter TOL.  The
     minimum along this line occurs when the function gradient G and the
     search direction P are orthogonal.  The line minimization
     terminates when dot(p,g) < tol |p| |g|.  The search direction is
     updated using the Fletcher-Reeves formula p' = g' - \beta g where
     \beta=-|g'|^2/|g|^2, and the line minimization is then repeated for
     the new search direction.

 -- Minimizer: gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_conjugate_pr
     This is the Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient algorithm.  It is
     similar to the Fletcher-Reeves method, differing only in the choice
     of the coefficient \beta.  Both methods work well when the
     evaluation point is close enough to the minimum of the objective
     function that it is well approximated by a quadratic hypersurface.

 -- Minimizer: gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_vector_bfgs2
 -- Minimizer: gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_vector_bfgs
     These methods use the vector Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
     (BFGS) algorithm.  This is a quasi-Newton method which builds up an
     approximation to the second derivatives of the function f using the
     difference between successive gradient vectors.  By combining the
     first and second derivatives the algorithm is able to take
     Newton-type steps towards the function minimum, assuming quadratic
     behavior in that region.

     The 'bfgs2' version of this minimizer is the most efficient version
     available, and is a faithful implementation of the line
     minimization scheme described in Fletcher's 'Practical Methods of
     Optimization', Algorithms 2.6.2 and 2.6.4.  It supersedes the
     original 'bfgs' routine and requires substantially fewer function
     and gradient evaluations.  The user-supplied tolerance TOL
     corresponds to the parameter \sigma used by Fletcher.  A value of
     0.1 is recommended for typical use (larger values correspond to
     less accurate line searches).

 -- Minimizer: gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_steepest_descent
     The steepest descent algorithm follows the downhill gradient of the
     function at each step.  When a downhill step is successful the
     step-size is increased by a factor of two.  If the downhill step
     leads to a higher function value then the algorithm backtracks and
     the step size is decreased using the parameter TOL.  A suitable
     value of TOL for most applications is 0.1.  The steepest descent
     method is inefficient and is included only for demonstration
     purposes.

36.8 Algorithms without Derivatives
===================================

The algorithms described in this section use only the value of the
function at each evaluation point.

 -- Minimizer: gsl_multimin_fminimizer_nmsimplex2
 -- Minimizer: gsl_multimin_fminimizer_nmsimplex
     These methods use the Simplex algorithm of Nelder and Mead.
     Starting from the initial vector X = p_0, the algorithm constructs
     an additional n vectors p_i using the step size vector s =
     STEP_SIZE as follows:

          p_0 = (x_0, x_1, ... , x_n)
          p_1 = (x_0 + s_0, x_1, ... , x_n)
          p_2 = (x_0, x_1 + s_1, ... , x_n)
          ... = ...
          p_n = (x_0, x_1, ... , x_n + s_n)

     These vectors form the n+1 vertices of a simplex in n dimensions.
     On each iteration the algorithm uses simple geometrical
     transformations to update the vector corresponding to the highest
     function value.  The geometric transformations are reflection,
     reflection followed by expansion, contraction and multiple
     contraction.  Using these transformations the simplex moves through
     the space towards the minimum, where it contracts itself.

     After each iteration, the best vertex is returned.  Note, that due
     to the nature of the algorithm not every step improves the current
     best parameter vector.  Usually several iterations are required.

     The minimizer-specific characteristic size is calculated as the
     average distance from the geometrical center of the simplex to all
     its vertices.  This size can be used as a stopping criteria, as the
     simplex contracts itself near the minimum.  The size is returned by
     the function 'gsl_multimin_fminimizer_size'.

     The 'nmsimplex2' version of this minimiser is a new O(N) operations
     implementation of the earlier O(N^2) operations 'nmsimplex'
     minimiser.  It uses the same underlying algorithm, but the simplex
     updates are computed more efficiently for high-dimensional
     problems.  In addition, the size of simplex is calculated as the
     RMS distance of each vertex from the center rather than the mean
     distance, allowing a linear update of this quantity on each step.
     The memory usage is O(N^2) for both algorithms.

 -- Minimizer: gsl_multimin_fminimizer_nmsimplex2rand
     This method is a variant of 'nmsimplex2' which initialises the
     simplex around the starting point X using a randomly-oriented set
     of basis vectors instead of the fixed coordinate axes.  The final
     dimensions of the simplex are scaled along the coordinate axes by
     the vector STEP_SIZE.  The randomisation uses a simple
     deterministic generator so that repeated calls to
     'gsl_multimin_fminimizer_set' for a given solver object will vary
     the orientation in a well-defined way.

36.9 Examples
=============

This example program finds the minimum of the paraboloid function
defined earlier.  The location of the minimum is offset from the origin
in x and y, and the function value at the minimum is non-zero.  The main
program is given below, it requires the example function given earlier
in this chapter.

     int
     main (void)
     {
       size_t iter = 0;
       int status;

       const gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_type *T;
       gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer *s;

       /* Position of the minimum (1,2), scale factors
          10,20, height 30. */
       double par[5] = { 1.0, 2.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0 };

       gsl_vector *x;
       gsl_multimin_function_fdf my_func;

       my_func.n = 2;
       my_func.f = my_f;
       my_func.df = my_df;
       my_func.fdf = my_fdf;
       my_func.params = par;

       /* Starting point, x = (5,7) */
       x = gsl_vector_alloc (2);
       gsl_vector_set (x, 0, 5.0);
       gsl_vector_set (x, 1, 7.0);

       T = gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_conjugate_fr;
       s = gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_alloc (T, 2);

       gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_set (s, &my_func, x, 0.01, 1e-4);

       do
         {
           iter++;
           status = gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_iterate (s);

           if (status)
             break;

           status = gsl_multimin_test_gradient (s->gradient, 1e-3);

           if (status == GSL_SUCCESS)
             printf ("Minimum found at:\n");

           printf ("%5d %.5f %.5f %10.5f\n", iter,
                   gsl_vector_get (s->x, 0),
                   gsl_vector_get (s->x, 1),
                   s->f);

         }
       while (status == GSL_CONTINUE && iter < 100);

       gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_free (s);
       gsl_vector_free (x);

       return 0;
     }

The initial step-size is chosen as 0.01, a conservative estimate in this
case, and the line minimization parameter is set at 0.0001.  The program
terminates when the norm of the gradient has been reduced below 0.001.
The output of the program is shown below,

              x       y         f
         1 4.99629 6.99072  687.84780
         2 4.98886 6.97215  683.55456
         3 4.97400 6.93501  675.01278
         4 4.94429 6.86073  658.10798
         5 4.88487 6.71217  625.01340
         6 4.76602 6.41506  561.68440
         7 4.52833 5.82083  446.46694
         8 4.05295 4.63238  261.79422
         9 3.10219 2.25548   75.49762
        10 2.85185 1.62963   67.03704
        11 2.19088 1.76182   45.31640
        12 0.86892 2.02622   30.18555
     Minimum found at:
        13 1.00000 2.00000   30.00000

Note that the algorithm gradually increases the step size as it
successfully moves downhill, as can be seen by plotting the successive
points.

The conjugate gradient algorithm finds the minimum on its second
direction because the function is purely quadratic.  Additional
iterations would be needed for a more complicated function.

   Here is another example using the Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm to
minimize the same example object function, as above.

     int
     main(void)
     {
       double par[5] = {1.0, 2.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0};

       const gsl_multimin_fminimizer_type *T =
         gsl_multimin_fminimizer_nmsimplex2;
       gsl_multimin_fminimizer *s = NULL;
       gsl_vector *ss, *x;
       gsl_multimin_function minex_func;

       size_t iter = 0;
       int status;
       double size;

       /* Starting point */
       x = gsl_vector_alloc (2);
       gsl_vector_set (x, 0, 5.0);
       gsl_vector_set (x, 1, 7.0);

       /* Set initial step sizes to 1 */
       ss = gsl_vector_alloc (2);
       gsl_vector_set_all (ss, 1.0);

       /* Initialize method and iterate */
       minex_func.n = 2;
       minex_func.f = my_f;
       minex_func.params = par;

       s = gsl_multimin_fminimizer_alloc (T, 2);
       gsl_multimin_fminimizer_set (s, &minex_func, x, ss);

       do
         {
           iter++;
           status = gsl_multimin_fminimizer_iterate(s);

           if (status)
             break;

           size = gsl_multimin_fminimizer_size (s);
           status = gsl_multimin_test_size (size, 1e-2);

           if (status == GSL_SUCCESS)
             {
               printf ("converged to minimum at\n");
             }

           printf ("%5d %10.3e %10.3e f() = %7.3f size = %.3f\n",
                   iter,
                   gsl_vector_get (s->x, 0),
                   gsl_vector_get (s->x, 1),
                   s->fval, size);
         }
       while (status == GSL_CONTINUE && iter < 100);

       gsl_vector_free(x);
       gsl_vector_free(ss);
       gsl_multimin_fminimizer_free (s);

       return status;
     }

The minimum search stops when the Simplex size drops to 0.01.  The
output is shown below.

     converged to minimum at

The simplex size first increases, while the simplex moves towards the
minimum.  After a while the size begins to decrease as the simplex
contracts around the minimum.

37 Least-Squares Fitting
************************

This chapter describes routines for performing least squares fits to
experimental data using linear combinations of functions.  The data may
be weighted or unweighted, i.e.  with known or unknown errors.  For
weighted data the functions compute the best fit parameters and their
associated covariance matrix.  For unweighted data the covariance matrix
is estimated from the scatter of the points, giving a
variance-covariance matrix.

   The functions are divided into separate versions for simple one- or
two-parameter regression and multiple-parameter fits.  The functions are
declared in the header file 'gsl_fit.h'.

37.1 Overview
=============

Least-squares fits are found by minimizing \chi^2 (chi-squared), the
weighted sum of squared residuals over n experimental datapoints (x_i,
y_i) for the model Y(c,x),

     \chi^2 = \sum_i w_i (y_i - Y(c, x_i))^2

The p parameters of the model are c = {c_0, c_1, ...}.  The weight
factors w_i are given by w_i = 1/\sigma_i^2, where \sigma_i is the
experimental error on the data-point y_i.  The errors are assumed to be
Gaussian and uncorrelated.  For unweighted data the chi-squared sum is
computed without any weight factors.

   The fitting routines return the best-fit parameters c and their p
\times p covariance matrix.  The covariance matrix measures the
statistical errors on the best-fit parameters resulting from the errors
on the data, \sigma_i, and is defined as C_{ab} = <\delta c_a \delta
c_b> where < > denotes an average over the Gaussian error distributions
of the underlying datapoints.

   The covariance matrix is calculated by error propagation from the
data errors \sigma_i.  The change in a fitted parameter \delta c_a
caused by a small change in the data \delta y_i is given by

     \delta c_a = \sum_i (dc_a/dy_i) \delta y_i

allowing the covariance matrix to be written in terms of the errors on
the data,

     C_{ab} = \sum_{i,j} (dc_a/dy_i) (dc_b/dy_j) <\delta y_i \delta y_j>

For uncorrelated data the fluctuations of the underlying datapoints
satisfy <\delta y_i \delta y_j> = \sigma_i^2 \delta_{ij}, giving a
corresponding parameter covariance matrix of

     C_{ab} = \sum_i (1/w_i) (dc_a/dy_i) (dc_b/dy_i)

When computing the covariance matrix for unweighted data, i.e.  data
with unknown errors, the weight factors w_i in this sum are replaced by
the single estimate w = 1/\sigma^2, where \sigma^2 is the computed
variance of the residuals about the best-fit model, \sigma^2 = \sum (y_i
- Y(c,x_i))^2 / (n-p).  This is referred to as the "variance-covariance
matrix".

   The standard deviations of the best-fit parameters are given by the
square root of the corresponding diagonal elements of the covariance
matrix, \sigma_{c_a} = \sqrt{C_{aa}}.  The correlation coefficient of
the fit parameters c_a and c_b is given by \rho_{ab} = C_{ab} /
\sqrt{C_{aa} C_{bb}}.

37.2 Linear regression
======================

The functions described in this section can be used to perform
least-squares fits to a straight line model, Y(c,x) = c_0 + c_1 x.

 -- Function: int gsl_fit_linear (const double * X, const size_t
          XSTRIDE, const double * Y, const size_t YSTRIDE, size_t N,
          double * C0, double * C1, double * COV00, double * COV01,
          double * COV11, double * SUMSQ)
     This function computes the best-fit linear regression coefficients
     (C0,C1) of the model Y = c_0 + c_1 X for the dataset (X, Y), two
     vectors of length N with strides XSTRIDE and YSTRIDE.  The errors
     on Y are assumed unknown so the variance-covariance matrix for the
     parameters (C0, C1) is estimated from the scatter of the points
     around the best-fit line and returned via the parameters (COV00,
     COV01, COV11).  The sum of squares of the residuals from the
     best-fit line is returned in SUMSQ.  Note: the correlation
     coefficient of the data can be computed using
     'gsl_stats_correlation' (*note Correlation::), it does not depend
     on the fit.

 -- Function: int gsl_fit_wlinear (const double * X, const size_t
          XSTRIDE, const double * W, const size_t WSTRIDE, const double
          * Y, const size_t YSTRIDE, size_t N, double * C0, double * C1,
          double * COV00, double * COV01, double * COV11, double *
          CHISQ)
     This function computes the best-fit linear regression coefficients
     (C0,C1) of the model Y = c_0 + c_1 X for the weighted dataset (X,
     Y), two vectors of length N with strides XSTRIDE and YSTRIDE.  The
     vector W, of length N and stride WSTRIDE, specifies the weight of
     each datapoint.  The weight is the reciprocal of the variance for
     each datapoint in Y.

     The covariance matrix for the parameters (C0, C1) is computed using
     the weights and returned via the parameters (COV00, COV01, COV11).

          double COV00, double COV01, double COV11, double * Y, double *
          Y_ERR)
     This function uses the best-fit linear regression coefficients C0,
     C1 and their covariance COV00, COV01, COV11 to compute the fitted
     function Y and its standard deviation Y_ERR for the model Y = c_0 +
     c_1 X at the point X.

37.3 Linear fitting without a constant term
===========================================

The functions described in this section can be used to perform
least-squares fits to a straight line model without a constant term, Y =
c_1 X.

 -- Function: int gsl_fit_mul (const double * X, const size_t XSTRIDE,
          const double * Y, const size_t YSTRIDE, size_t N, double * C1,
          double * COV11, double * SUMSQ)
     This function computes the best-fit linear regression coefficient
     C1 of the model Y = c_1 X for the datasets (X, Y), two vectors of
     length N with strides XSTRIDE and YSTRIDE.  The errors on Y are
     assumed unknown so the variance of the parameter C1 is estimated
     from the scatter of the points around the best-fit line and
     returned via the parameter COV11.  The sum of squares of the
     residuals from the best-fit line is returned in SUMSQ.

 -- Function: int gsl_fit_wmul (const double * X, const size_t XSTRIDE,
          const double * W, const size_t WSTRIDE, const double * Y,
          const size_t YSTRIDE, size_t N, double * C1, double * COV11,
          double * SUMSQ)
     This function computes the best-fit linear regression coefficient
     C1 of the model Y = c_1 X for the weighted datasets (X, Y), two
     vectors of length N with strides XSTRIDE and YSTRIDE.  The vector
     W, of length N and stride WSTRIDE, specifies the weight of each
     datapoint.  The weight is the reciprocal of the variance for each
     datapoint in Y.

     The variance of the parameter C1 is computed using the weights and
     returned via the parameter COV11.  The weighted sum of squares of
     the residuals from the best-fit line, \chi^2, is returned in CHISQ.

 -- Function: int gsl_fit_mul_est (double X, double C1, double COV11,
          double * Y, double * Y_ERR)

37.4 Multi-parameter fitting
============================

The functions described in this section perform least-squares fits to a
general linear model, y = X c where y is a vector of n observations, X
is an n by p matrix of predictor variables, and the elements of the
vector c are the p unknown best-fit parameters which are to be
estimated.  The chi-squared value is given by \chi^2 = \sum_i w_i (y_i -
\sum_j X_{ij} c_j)^2.

   This formulation can be used for fits to any number of functions
and/or variables by preparing the n-by-p matrix X appropriately.  For
example, to fit to a p-th order polynomial in X, use the following
matrix,

     X_{ij} = x_i^j

where the index i runs over the observations and the index j runs from 0
to p-1.

   To fit to a set of p sinusoidal functions with fixed frequencies
\omega_1, \omega_2, ..., \omega_p, use,

     X_{ij} = sin(\omega_j x_i)

To fit to p independent variables x_1, x_2, ..., x_p, use,

     X_{ij} = x_j(i)

where x_j(i) is the i-th value of the predictor variable x_j.

   The functions described in this section are declared in the header
file 'gsl_multifit.h'.

   The solution of the general linear least-squares system requires an
additional working space for intermediate results, such as the singular
value decomposition of the matrix X.

          (size_t N, size_t P)
     This function allocates a workspace for fitting a model to N
     observations using P parameters.

          gsl_vector * Y, gsl_vector * C, gsl_matrix * COV, double *
          CHISQ, gsl_multifit_linear_workspace * WORK)
     This function computes the best-fit parameters C of the model y = X
     c for the observations Y and the matrix of predictor variables X,
     using the preallocated workspace provided in WORK.  The p-by-p
     variance-covariance matrix of the model parameters COV is set to
     \sigma^2 (X^T X)^{-1}, where \sigma is the standard deviation of
     the fit residuals.  The sum of squares of the residuals from the
     best-fit, \chi^2, is returned in CHISQ.  If the coefficient of
     determination is desired, it can be computed from the expression
     R^2 = 1 - \chi^2 / TSS, where the total sum of squares (TSS) of the
     observations Y may be computed from 'gsl_stats_tss'.

     The best-fit is found by singular value decomposition of the matrix
     X using the modified Golub-Reinsch SVD algorithm, with column
     scaling to improve the accuracy of the singular values.  Any
     components which have zero singular value (to machine precision)
     are discarded from the fit.

     This function computes the best-fit parameters C of the weighted
     model y = X c for the observations Y with weights W and the matrix
     of predictor variables X, using the preallocated workspace provided
     in WORK.  The p-by-p covariance matrix of the model parameters COV
     is computed as (X^T W X)^{-1}.  The weighted sum of squares of the
     residuals from the best-fit, \chi^2, is returned in CHISQ.  If the
     coefficient of determination is desired, it can be computed from
     the expression R^2 = 1 - \chi^2 / WTSS, where the weighted total
     sum of squares (WTSS) of the observations Y may be computed from
     'gsl_stats_wtss'.

          gsl_multifit_linear_workspace * WORK)
 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_wlinear_svd (const gsl_matrix * X, const
          gsl_vector * W, const gsl_vector * Y, double TOL, size_t *
          RANK, gsl_vector * C, gsl_matrix * COV, double * CHISQ,
          gsl_multifit_linear_workspace * WORK)
     In these functions components of the fit are discarded if the ratio
     of singular values s_i/s_0 falls below the user-specified tolerance
     TOL, and the effective rank is returned in RANK.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_linear_usvd (const gsl_matrix * X, const
          gsl_vector * Y, double TOL, size_t * RANK, gsl_vector * C,

          RANK, gsl_vector * C, gsl_matrix * COV, double * CHISQ,
          gsl_multifit_linear_workspace * WORK)
     These functions compute the fit using an SVD without column
     scaling.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_linear_est (const gsl_vector * X, const
          gsl_vector * C, const gsl_matrix * COV, double * Y, double *
          Y_ERR)
     This function uses the best-fit multilinear regression coefficients
     C and their covariance matrix COV to compute the fitted function
     value Y and its standard deviation Y_ERR for the model y = x.c at

37.5 Robust linear regression
=============================

Ordinary least squares (OLS) models are often heavily influenced by the
presence of outliers.  Outliers are data points which do not follow the
general trend of the other observations, although there is strictly no
precise definition of an outlier.  Robust linear regression refers to
regression algorithms which are robust to outliers.  The most common
type of robust regression is M-estimation.  The general M-estimator
minimizes the objective function

     \sum_i \rho(e_i) = \sum_i \rho (y_i - Y(c, x_i))

   where e_i = y_i - Y(c, x_i) is the residual of the ith data point,
and \rho(e_i) is a function which should have the following properties:
     \rho(e) \ge 0
     \rho(0) = 0
     \rho(-e) = \rho(e)
     \rho(e_1) > \rho(e_2) for |e_1| > |e_2|
The special case of ordinary least squares is given by \rho(e_i) =
e_i^2.  Letting \psi = \rho' be the derivative of \rho, differentiating
the objective function with respect to the coefficients c and setting
the partial derivatives to zero produces the system of equations

     \sum_i \psi(e_i) X_i = 0

   where X_i is a vector containing row i of the design matrix X.  Next,
we define a weight function w(e) = \psi(e)/e, and let w_i = w(e_i):

     \sum_i w_i e_i X_i = 0

   This system of equations is equivalent to solving a weighted ordinary
least squares problem, minimizing \chi^2 = \sum_i w_i e_i^2.  The
weights however, depend on the residuals e_i, which depend on the
coefficients c, which depend on the weights.  Therefore, an iterative
solution is used, called Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS).
  1. Compute initial estimates of the coefficients c^{(0)} using
     ordinary least squares

  2. For iteration k, form the residuals e_i^{(k)} = (y_i - X_i
     c^{(k-1)})/(t \sigma^{(k)} \sqrt{1 - h_i}), where t is a tuning
     constant depending on the choice of \psi, and h_i are the
     statistical leverages (diagonal elements of the matrix X (X^T
     X)^{-1} X^T).  Including t and h_i in the residual calculation has
     been shown to improve the convergence of the method.  The residual
     standard deviation is approximated as \sigma^{(k)} = MAD / 0.6745,
     where MAD is the Median-Absolute-Deviation of the n-p largest
     residuals from the previous iteration.

  3. Compute new weights w_i^{(k)} = \psi(e_i^{(k)})/e_i^{(k)}.

  4. Compute new coefficients c^{(k)} by solving the weighted least
     squares problem with weights w_i^{(k)}.

  5. Steps 2 through 4 are iterated until the coefficients converge or
     until some maximum iteration limit is reached.  Coefficients are
     tested for convergence using the critera:

          |c_i^(k) - c_i^(k-1)| \le \epsilon \times max(|c_i^(k)|, |c_i^(k-1)|)

     for all 0 \le i < p where \epsilon is a small tolerance factor.
The key to this method lies in selecting the function \psi(e_i) to
assign smaller weights to large residuals, and larger weights to smaller
residuals.  As the iteration proceeds, outliers are assigned smaller and
smaller weights, eventually having very little or no effect on the
fitted model.

 -- Function: gsl_multifit_robust_workspace * gsl_multifit_robust_alloc
          (const gsl_multifit_robust_type * T, const size_t N, const
          size_t P)
     This function allocates a workspace for fitting a model to N
     observations using P parameters.  The type T specifies the function
     \psi and can be selected from the following choices.
      -- Robust type: gsl_multifit_robust_default
          This specifies the 'gsl_multifit_robust_bisquare' type (see
          below) and is a good general purpose choice for robust
          regression.

      -- Robust type: gsl_multifit_robust_bisquare
          This is Tukey's biweight (bisquare) function and is a good
          general purpose choice for robust regression.  The weight
          function is given by

               w(e) = (1 - e^2)^2

          and the default tuning constant is t = 4.685.

      -- Robust type: gsl_multifit_robust_cauchy
          This is Cauchy's function, also known as the Lorentzian
          function.  This function does not guarantee a unique solution,
          meaning different choices of the coefficient vector C could
          minimize the objective function.  Therefore this option should
          be used with care.  The weight function is given by

               w(e) = 1 / (1 + e^2)

          and the default tuning constant is t = 2.385.

      -- Robust type: gsl_multifit_robust_fair
          This is the fair \rho function, which guarantees a unique
          solution and has continuous derivatives to three orders.  The
          weight function is given by

               w(e) = 1 / (1 + |e|)

          and the default tuning constant is t = 1.400.

      -- Robust type: gsl_multifit_robust_huber
          This specifies Huber's \rho function, which is a parabola in
          the vicinity of zero and increases linearly for a given
          threshold |e| > t.  This function is also considered an
          excellent general purpose robust estimator, however,
          occasional difficulties can be encountered due to the
          discontinuous first derivative of the \psi function.  The
          weight function is given by

               w(e) = 1/max(1,|e|)

          and the default tuning constant is t = 1.345.

      -- Robust type: gsl_multifit_robust_ols
          This specifies the ordinary least squares solution, which can
          be useful for quickly checking the difference between the
          various robust and OLS solutions.  The weight function is
          given by

               w(e) = 1

          and the default tuning constant is t = 1.

      -- Robust type: gsl_multifit_robust_welsch
          This specifies the Welsch function which can perform well in
          cases where the residuals have an exponential distribution.
          The weight function is given by

               w(e) = \exp(-e^2)

          and the default tuning constant is t = 2.985.

 -- Function: void gsl_multifit_robust_free
          (gsl_multifit_robust_workspace * W)
     This function frees the memory associated with the workspace W.

 -- Function: const char * gsl_multifit_robust_name (const
          gsl_multifit_robust_workspace * W)
     This function returns the name of the robust type T specified to
     'gsl_multifit_robust_alloc'.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_robust_tune (const double TUNE,
          gsl_multifit_robust_workspace * W)
     This function sets the tuning constant t used to adjust the
     residuals at each iteration to TUNE.  Decreasing the tuning
     constant increases the downweight assigned to large residuals,
     while increasing the tuning constant decreases the downweight
     assigned to large residuals.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_robust (const gsl_matrix * X, const
          gsl_vector * Y, gsl_vector * C, gsl_matrix * COV,
          gsl_multifit_robust_workspace * W)
     This function computes the best-fit parameters C of the model y = X
     c for the observations Y and the matrix of predictor variables X,
     attemping to reduce the influence of outliers using the algorithm
     outlined above.  The p-by-p variance-covariance matrix of the model
     parameters COV is estimated as \sigma^2 (X^T X)^{-1}, where \sigma
     is an approximation of the residual standard deviation using the
     theory of robust regression.  Special care must be taken when
     estimating \sigma and other statistics such as R^2, and so these
     are computed internally and are available by calling the function
     'gsl_multifit_robust_statistics'.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_robust_est (const gsl_vector * X, const
          gsl_vector * C, const gsl_matrix * COV, double * Y, double *
          Y_ERR)
     This function uses the best-fit robust regression coefficients C
     and their covariance matrix COV to compute the fitted function
     value Y and its standard deviation Y_ERR for the model y = x.c at
     the point X.

 -- Function: gsl_multifit_robust_stats gsl_multifit_robust_statistics
          (const gsl_multifit_robust_workspace * W)
     This function returns a structure containing relevant statistics
     from a robust regression.  The function 'gsl_multifit_robust' must
     be called first to perform the regression and calculate these
     statistics.  The returned 'gsl_multifit_robust_stats' structure
     contains the following fields.
          double 'sigma_ols' This contains the standard deviation of the
          residuals as computed from ordinary least squares (OLS).

          double 'sigma_mad' This contains an estimate of the standard
          deviation of the final residuals using the
          Median-Absolute-Deviation statistic

          double 'sigma_rob' This contains an estimate of the standard
          deviation of the final residuals from the theory of robust
          regression (see Street et al, 1988).

          double 'sigma' This contains an estimate of the standard
          deviation of the final residuals by attemping to reconcile
          'sigma_rob' and 'sigma_ols' in a reasonable way.

          double 'Rsq' This contains the R^2 coefficient of
          determination statistic using the estimate 'sigma'.

          double 'adj_Rsq' This contains the adjusted R^2 coefficient of
          determination statistic using the estimate 'sigma'.

          double 'rmse' This contains the root mean squared error of the
          final residuals

          double 'sse' This contains the residual sum of squares taking
          into account the robust covariance matrix.

          size_t 'dof' This contains the number of degrees of freedom n
          - p

          size_t 'numit' Upon successful convergence, this contains the
          number of iterations performed

37.6 Troubleshooting
====================

When using models based on polynomials, care should be taken when
constructing the design matrix X.  If the x values are large, then the
matrix X could be ill-conditioned since its columns are powers of x,
leading to unstable least-squares solutions.  In this case it can often
help to center and scale the x values using the mean and standard
deviation:

     x' = (x - mu)/sigma

and then construct the X matrix using the transformed values x'.

37.7 Examples
=============

The following program computes a least squares straight-line fit to a
simple dataset, and outputs the best-fit line and its associated one
standard-deviation error bars.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <gsl/gsl_fit.h>

     int
     main (void)
     {
       int i, n = 4;
       double x[4] = { 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 };
       double y[4] = {   12,   11,   14,   13 };
       double w[4] = {  0.1,  0.2,  0.3,  0.4 };

       double c0, c1, cov00, cov01, cov11, chisq;

       gsl_fit_wlinear (x, 1, w, 1, y, 1, n,
                        &c0, &c1, &cov00, &cov01, &cov11,
                        &chisq);

       printf ("# best fit: Y = %g + %g X\n", c0, c1);
       printf ("# covariance matrix:\n");
       printf ("# [ %g, %g\n#   %g, %g]\n",
               cov00, cov01, cov01, cov11);
       printf ("# chisq = %g\n", chisq);

       for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
         printf ("data: %g %g %g\n",
                        x[i], y[i], 1/sqrt(w[i]));

       printf ("\n");

       for (i = -30; i < 130; i++)
         {
           double xf = x[0] + (i/100.0) * (x[n-1] - x[0]);
           double yf, yf_err;

           gsl_fit_linear_est (xf,
                               c0, c1,
                               cov00, cov01, cov11,
                               &yf, &yf_err);

           printf ("fit: %g %g\n", xf, yf);
           printf ("hi : %g %g\n", xf, yf + yf_err);
           printf ("lo : %g %g\n", xf, yf - yf_err);
         }
       return 0;
     }

The following commands extract the data from the output of the program
and display it using the GNU plotutils 'graph' utility,

     $ ./demo > tmp
     $ more tmp
     # best fit: Y = -106.6 + 0.06 X
     # covariance matrix:
     # [ 39602, -19.9
     #   -19.9, 0.01]
     # chisq = 0.8

     $ for n in data fit hi lo ;
        do
          grep "^$n" tmp | cut -d: -f2 > $n ;
        done
     $ graph -T X -X x -Y y -y 0 20 -m 0 -S 2 -Ie data
          -S 0 -I a -m 1 fit -m 2 hi -m 2 lo

   The next program performs a quadratic fit y = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2
to a weighted dataset using the generalised linear fitting function
'gsl_multifit_wlinear'.  The model matrix X for a quadratic fit is given
by,

     X = [ 1   , x_0  , x_0^2 ;
           1   , x_1  , x_1^2 ;
           1   , x_2  , x_2^2 ;
           ... , ...  , ...   ]

where the column of ones corresponds to the constant term c_0.  The two
remaining columns corresponds to the terms c_1 x and c_2 x^2.

   The program reads N lines of data in the format (X, Y, ERR) where ERR
is the error (standard deviation) in the value Y.

     #include <stdio.h>

         {
           int count = fscanf (stdin, "%lg %lg %lg",
                               &xi, &yi, &ei);

           if (count != 3)
             {
               fprintf (stderr, "error reading file\n");

           gsl_vector_set (y, i, yi);
           gsl_vector_set (w, i, 1.0/(ei*ei));

         printf ("[ %+.5e, %+.5e, %+.5e  \n",
                    COV(0,0), COV(0,1), COV(0,2));
         printf ("  %+.5e, %+.5e, %+.5e  \n",
                    COV(1,0), COV(1,1), COV(1,2));
         printf ("  %+.5e, %+.5e, %+.5e ]\n",

       }

       gsl_matrix_free (X);

       gsl_vector_free (c);
       gsl_matrix_free (cov);

       return 0;
     }

A suitable set of data for fitting can be generated using the following
program.  It outputs a set of points with gaussian errors from the curve
y = e^x in the region 0 < x < 2.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <math.h>
     #include <gsl/gsl_randist.h>

     int
     main (void)
     {
       double x;
       const gsl_rng_type * T;
       gsl_rng * r;

       gsl_rng_env_setup ();

       T = gsl_rng_default;
       r = gsl_rng_alloc (T);

       for (x = 0.1; x < 2; x+= 0.1)
         {
           double y0 = exp (x);
           double sigma = 0.1 * y0;
           double dy = gsl_ran_gaussian (r, sigma);

           printf ("%g %g %g\n", x, y0 + dy, sigma);
         }

       gsl_rng_free(r);

       return 0;
     }

The data can be prepared by running the resulting executable program,

     $ GSL_RNG_TYPE=mt19937_1999 ./generate > exp.dat
     $ more exp.dat
     0.1 0.97935 0.110517

     0.3 1.52573 0.134986
     0.4 1.60318 0.149182
     0.5 1.81731 0.164872
     0.6 1.92475 0.182212
     ....

To fit the data use the previous program, with the number of data points
given as the first argument.  In this case there are 19 data points.

     $ ./fit 19 < exp.dat
     0.1 0.97935 +/- 0.110517
     0.2 1.3359 +/- 0.12214
     ...
     # best fit: Y = 1.02318 + 0.956201 X + 0.876796 X^2
     # covariance matrix:
     [ +1.25612e-02, -3.64387e-02, +1.94389e-02
       -3.64387e-02, +1.42339e-01, -8.48761e-02
       +1.94389e-02, -8.48761e-02, +5.60243e-02 ]
     # chisq = 23.0987

The parameters of the quadratic fit match the coefficients of the
expansion of e^x, taking into account the errors on the parameters and
the O(x^3) difference between the exponential and quadratic functions
for the larger values of x.  The errors on the parameters are given by
the square-root of the corresponding diagonal elements of the covariance
matrix.  The chi-squared per degree of freedom is 1.4, indicating a
reasonable fit to the data.

   The next program demonstrates the advantage of robust least squares
on a dataset with outliers.  The program generates linear (x,y) data
pairs on the line y = 1.45 x + 3.88, adds some random noise, and inserts
3 outliers into the dataset.  Both the robust and ordinary least squares
(OLS) coefficients are computed for comparison.

38 Nonlinear Least-Squares Fitting
**********************************

This chapter describes functions for multidimensional nonlinear
least-squares fitting.  The library provides low level components for a
variety of iterative solvers and convergence tests.  These can be
combined by the user to achieve the desired solution, with full access
to the intermediate steps of the iteration.  Each class of methods uses
the same framework, so that you can switch between solvers at runtime
without needing to recompile your program.  Each instance of a solver
keeps track of its own state, allowing the solvers to be used in
multi-threaded programs.

   The header file 'gsl_multifit_nlin.h' contains prototypes for the
multidimensional nonlinear fitting functions and related declarations.

38.1 Overview
=============

The problem of multidimensional nonlinear least-squares fitting requires
the minimization of the squared residuals of n functions, f_i, in p
parameters, x_i,

     \Phi(x) = (1/2) || F(x) ||^2
             = (1/2) \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(x_1, ..., x_p)^2

All algorithms proceed from an initial guess using the linearization,

     \psi(p) = || F(x+p) || ~=~ || F(x) + J p ||

where x is the initial point, p is the proposed step and J is the
Jacobian matrix J_{ij} = d f_i / d x_j.  Additional strategies are used
to enlarge the region of convergence.  These include requiring a
decrease in the norm ||F|| on each step or using a trust region to avoid
steps which fall outside the linear regime.

   To perform a weighted least-squares fit of a nonlinear model Y(x,t)
to data (t_i, y_i) with independent Gaussian errors \sigma_i, use
function components of the following form,

     f_i = (Y(x, t_i) - y_i) / \sigma_i

Note that the model parameters are denoted by x in this chapter since
the non-linear least-squares algorithms are described geometrically
(i.e.  finding the minimum of a surface).  The independent variable of
any data to be fitted is denoted by t.

   With the definition above the Jacobian is J_{ij} =(1 / \sigma_i) d
Y_i / d x_j, where Y_i = Y(x,t_i).

38.2 Initializing the Solver
============================

 -- Function: gsl_multifit_fsolver * gsl_multifit_fsolver_alloc (const
          gsl_multifit_fsolver_type * T, size_t N, size_t P)
     This function returns a pointer to a newly allocated instance of a
     solver of type T for N observations and P parameters.  The number
     of observations N must be greater than or equal to parameters P.

     If there is insufficient memory to create the solver then the
     function returns a null pointer and the error handler is invoked
     with an error code of 'GSL_ENOMEM'.

 -- Function: gsl_multifit_fdfsolver * gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_alloc
          (const gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_type * T, size_t N, size_t P)
     This function returns a pointer to a newly allocated instance of a
     derivative solver of type T for N observations and P parameters.
     For example, the following code creates an instance of a
     Levenberg-Marquardt solver for 100 data points and 3 parameters,

          const gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_type * T
              = gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_lmder;
          gsl_multifit_fdfsolver * s
              = gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_alloc (T, 100, 3);

     The number of observations N must be greater than or equal to
     parameters P.

     If there is insufficient memory to create the solver then the
     function returns a null pointer and the error handler is invoked
     with an error code of 'GSL_ENOMEM'.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_fsolver_set (gsl_multifit_fsolver * S,
          gsl_multifit_function * F, const gsl_vector * X)
     This function initializes, or reinitializes, an existing solver S
     to use the function F and the initial guess X.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_set (gsl_multifit_fdfsolver *
          S, gsl_multifit_function_fdf * FDF, const gsl_vector * X)

38.3 Providing the Function to be Minimized
===========================================

You must provide n functions of p variables for the minimization
algorithms to operate on.  In order to allow for arbitrary parameters
the functions are defined by the following data types:

 -- Data Type: gsl_multifit_function
     This data type defines a general system of functions with arbitrary
     parameters.

     'int (* f) (const gsl_vector * X, void * PARAMS, gsl_vector * F)'
          this function should store the vector result f(x,params) in F
          for argument X and arbitrary parameters PARAMS, returning an
          appropriate error code if the function cannot be computed.

     'size_t n'
          the number of functions, i.e.  the number of components of the
          vector F.

     'size_t p'
          the number of independent variables, i.e.  the number of
          components of the vector X.

     'void * params'
          a pointer to the arbitrary parameters of the function.

 -- Data Type: gsl_multifit_function_fdf
     This data type defines a general system of functions with arbitrary
     parameters and the corresponding Jacobian matrix of derivatives,

     'int (* f) (const gsl_vector * X, void * PARAMS, gsl_vector * F)'
          this function should store the vector result f(x,params) in F
          for argument X and arbitrary parameters PARAMS, returning an
          appropriate error code if the function cannot be computed.

     'int (* df) (const gsl_vector * X, void * PARAMS, gsl_matrix * J)'
          this function should store the N-by-P matrix result J_ij = d
          f_i(x,params) / d x_j in J for argument X and arbitrary
          parameters PARAMS, returning an appropriate error code if the
          function cannot be computed.  If an analytic Jacobian is
          unavailable, or too expensive to compute, this function
          pointer may be set to NULL, in which case the Jacobian will be
          internally computed using finite difference approximations of
          the function F.

     'int (* fdf) (const gsl_vector * X, void * PARAMS, gsl_vector * F, gsl_matrix * J)'
          This function should set the values of the F and J as above,
          for arguments X and arbitrary parameters PARAMS.  This
          function provides an optimization of the separate functions
          for f(x) and J(x)--it is always faster to compute the function
          and its derivative at the same time.  If an analytic Jacobian
          is unavailable, or too expensive to compute, this function
          pointer may be set to NULL, in which case the Jacobian will be
          internally computed using finite difference approximations of
          the function F.

     'size_t n'
          the number of functions, i.e.  the number of components of the
          vector F.

     'size_t p'
          the number of independent variables, i.e.  the number of
          components of the vector X.

     'void * params'
          a pointer to the arbitrary parameters of the function.

   Note that when fitting a non-linear model against experimental data,
the data is passed to the functions above using the PARAMS argument and
the trial best-fit parameters through the X argument.

38.4 Finite Difference Jacobian
===============================

For the algorithms which require a Jacobian matrix of derivatives of the
fit functions, there are times when an analytic Jacobian may be
unavailable or too expensive to compute.  Therefore GSL supports
approximating the Jacobian numerically using finite differences of the
fit functions.  This is typically done by setting the relevant function
pointers of the 'gsl_multifit_function_fdf' data type to NULL, however
the following functions allow the user to access the approximate
Jacobian directly if needed.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_dif_df (const gsl_vector * X,
          gsl_multifit_function_fdf * FDF, const gsl_vector * F,
          gsl_matrix * J)
     This function takes as input the current position X with the
     function values computed at the current position F, along with FDF
     which specifies the fit function and parameters and approximates
     the N-by-P Jacobian J using forward finite differences: J_ij = d
     f_i(x,params) / d x_j = (f_i(x^*,params) - f_i(x,params)) / d x_j.
     where x^* has the jth element perturbed by \Delta x_j and \Delta
     x_j = \epsilon |x_j|, where \epsilon is the square root of the
     machine precision 'GSL_DBL_EPSILON'.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_dif_fdf (const gsl_vector * X,
          gsl_multifit_function_fdf * FDF, gsl_vector * F, gsl_matrix *
          J)
     This function computes the vector of function values F and the
     approximate Jacobian J at the position vector X using the system
     described in FDF.  See 'gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_dif_df' for a
     description of how the Jacobian is computed.

38.5 Iteration
==============

The following functions drive the iteration of each algorithm.  Each
function performs one iteration to update the state of any solver of the
corresponding type.  The same functions work for all solvers so that
different methods can be substituted at runtime without modifications to
the code.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_fsolver_iterate (gsl_multifit_fsolver *
          S)
 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_iterate (gsl_multifit_fdfsolver
          * S)
     These functions perform a single iteration of the solver S.  If the
     iteration encounters an unexpected problem then an error code will
     be returned.  The solver maintains a current estimate of the
     best-fit parameters at all times.

   The solver struct S contains the following entries, which can be used
to track the progress of the solution:

'gsl_vector * x'
     The current position.

'gsl_vector * f'
     The function value at the current position.

'gsl_vector * dx'
     The difference between the current position and the previous
     position, i.e.  the last step, taken as a vector.

'gsl_matrix * J'
     The Jacobian matrix at the current position (for the
     'gsl_multifit_fdfsolver' struct only)

   The best-fit information also can be accessed with the following
auxiliary functions,

 -- Function: gsl_vector * gsl_multifit_fsolver_position (const
          gsl_multifit_fsolver * S)
 -- Function: gsl_vector * gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_position (const
          gsl_multifit_fdfsolver * S)
     These functions return the current position (i.e.  best-fit
     parameters) 's->x' of the solver S.

38.6 Search Stopping Parameters
===============================

A minimization procedure should stop when one of the following
conditions is true:

   * A minimum has been found to within the user-specified precision.

   * A user-specified maximum number of iterations has been reached.

   * An error has occurred.

The handling of these conditions is under user control.  The functions
below allow the user to test the current estimate of the best-fit
parameters in several standard ways.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_test_delta (const gsl_vector * DX, const
          gsl_vector * X, double EPSABS, double EPSREL)

     This function tests for the convergence of the sequence by
     comparing the last step DX with the absolute error EPSABS and
     relative error EPSREL to the current position X.  The test returns
     'GSL_SUCCESS' if the following condition is achieved,

          |dx_i| < epsabs + epsrel |x_i|

     for each component of X and returns 'GSL_CONTINUE' otherwise.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_test_gradient (const gsl_vector * G,
          double EPSABS)
     This function tests the residual gradient G against the absolute
     error bound EPSABS.  Mathematically, the gradient should be exactly
     zero at the minimum.  The test returns 'GSL_SUCCESS' if the
     following condition is achieved,

          \sum_i |g_i| < epsabs

     and returns 'GSL_CONTINUE' otherwise.  This criterion is suitable
     for situations where the precise location of the minimum, x, is
     unimportant provided a value can be found where the gradient is
     small enough.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_gradient (const gsl_matrix * J, const
          gsl_vector * F, gsl_vector * G)
     This function computes the gradient G of \Phi(x) = (1/2) ||F(x)||^2
     from the Jacobian matrix J and the function values F, using the
     formula g = J^T f.

38.7 High Level Driver
======================

These routines provide a high level wrapper that combine the iteration
and convergence testing for easy use.

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_fsolver_driver (gsl_multifit_fsolver * S,
          const size_t MAXITER, const double EPSABS, const double
          EPSREL)
 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_driver (gsl_multifit_fdfsolver
          * S, const size_t MAXITER, const double EPSABS, const double
          EPSREL)
     These functions iterate the solver S for a maximum of MAXITER
     iterations.  After each iteration, the system is tested for
     convergence using 'gsl_multifit_test_delta' with the error
     tolerances EPSABS and EPSREL.


File: gsl-ref.info,  Node: Minimization Algorithms using Derivatives,  Next: Minimization Algorithms without Derivatives,  Prev: High Level Driver,  Up: Nonlinear Least-Squares Fitting

38.8 Minimization Algorithms using Derivatives
==============================================

The minimization algorithms described in this section make use of both
the function and its derivative.  They require an initial guess for the
location of the minimum.  There is no absolute guarantee of
convergence--the function must be suitable for this technique and the
initial guess must be sufficiently close to the minimum for it to work.

 -- Derivative Solver: gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_lmsder
     This is a robust and efficient version of the Levenberg-Marquardt
     algorithm as implemented in the scaled LMDER routine in MINPACK.
     Minpack was written by Jorge J. More', Burton S. Garbow and Kenneth
     E. Hillstrom.

     The algorithm uses a generalized trust region to keep each step
     under control.  In order to be accepted a proposed new position x'
     must satisfy the condition |D (x' - x)| < \delta, where D is a
     diagonal scaling matrix and \delta is the size of the trust region.
     The components of D are computed internally, using the column norms
     of the Jacobian to estimate the sensitivity of the residual to each
     component of x.  This improves the behavior of the algorithm for
     badly scaled functions.

     On each iteration the algorithm attempts to minimize the linear
     system |F + J p| subject to the constraint |D p| < \Delta.  The
     solution to this constrained linear system is found using the
     Levenberg-Marquardt method.

     The proposed step is now tested by evaluating the function at the
     resulting point, x'.  If the step reduces the norm of the function
     sufficiently, and follows the predicted behavior of the function
     within the trust region, then it is accepted and the size of the
     trust region is increased.  If the proposed step fails to improve
     the solution, or differs significantly from the expected behavior
     within the trust region, then the size of the trust region is
     decreased and another trial step is computed.

     The algorithm also monitors the progress of the solution and
     returns an error if the changes in the solution are smaller than
     the machine precision.  The possible error codes are,

     'GSL_ETOLF'
          the decrease in the function falls below machine precision

     'GSL_ETOLX'
          the change in the position vector falls below machine
          precision

     'GSL_ETOLG'
          the norm of the gradient, relative to the norm of the
          function, falls below machine precision

     'GSL_ENOPROG'
          the routine has made 10 or more attempts to find a suitable
          trial step without success (but subsequent calls can be made
          to continue the search).(1)

     These error codes indicate that further iterations will be unlikely
     to change the solution from its current value.

 -- Derivative Solver: gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_lmder
     This is an unscaled version of the LMDER algorithm.  The elements
     of the diagonal scaling matrix D are set to 1.  This algorithm may
     be useful in circumstances where the scaled version of LMDER
     converges too slowly, or the function is already scaled
     appropriately.

   (1) The return code 'GSL_CONTINUE' was used for this case in versions
prior to 1.14.

38.10 Computing the covariance matrix of best fit parameters
============================================================

 -- Function: int gsl_multifit_covar (const gsl_matrix * J, double
          EPSREL, gsl_matrix * COVAR)
     This function uses the Jacobian matrix J to compute the covariance
     matrix of the best-fit parameters, COVAR.  The parameter EPSREL is
     used to remove linear-dependent columns when J is rank deficient.

     The covariance matrix is given by,

          covar = (J^T J)^{-1}

     and is computed by QR decomposition of J with column-pivoting.  Any
     columns of R which satisfy

          |R_{kk}| <= epsrel |R_{11}|

     are considered linearly-dependent and are excluded from the
     covariance matrix (the corresponding rows and columns of the
     covariance matrix are set to zero).

     If the minimisation uses the weighted least-squares function f_i =
     (Y(x, t_i) - y_i) / \sigma_i then the covariance matrix above gives
     the statistical error on the best-fit parameters resulting from the
     Gaussian errors \sigma_i on the underlying data y_i.  This can be
     verified from the relation \delta f = J \delta c and the fact that
     the fluctuations in f from the data y_i are normalised by \sigma_i
     and so satisfy <\delta f \delta f^T> = I.

     For an unweighted least-squares function f_i = (Y(x, t_i) - y_i)
     the covariance matrix above should be multiplied by the variance of
     the residuals about the best-fit \sigma^2 = \sum (y_i - Y(x,t_i))^2
     / (n-p) to give the variance-covariance matrix \sigma^2 C.  This
     estimates the statistical error on the best-fit parameters from the
     scatter of the underlying data.

     For more information about covariance matrices see *note Fitting
     Overview::.

38.11 Examples
==============

The following example program fits a weighted exponential model with
background to experimental data, Y = A \exp(-\lambda t) + b.  The first
part of the program sets up the functions 'expb_f' and 'expb_df' to
calculate the model and its Jacobian.  The appropriate fitting function
is given by,

     f_i = ((A \exp(-\lambda t_i) + b) - y_i)/\sigma_i

where we have chosen t_i = i.  The Jacobian matrix J is the derivative
of these functions with respect to the three parameters (A, \lambda, b).
It is given by,

     J_{ij} = d f_i / d x_j

where x_0 = A, x_1 = \lambda and x_2 = b.

The approximate values of the parameters are found correctly, and the
chi-squared value indicates a good fit (the chi-squared per degree of
freedom is approximately 1).  In this case the errors on the parameters
can be estimated from the square roots of the diagonal elements of the
covariance matrix.

   If the chi-squared value shows a poor fit (i.e.  chi^2/dof >> 1) then
the error estimates obtained from the covariance matrix will be too
small.  In the example program the error estimates are multiplied by
\sqrt{\chi^2/dof} in this case, a common way of increasing the errors
for a poor fit.  Note that a poor fit will result from the use an
inappropriate model, and the scaled error estimates may then be outside
the range of validity for Gaussian errors.

****************

This chapter describes functions for the computation of smoothing basis
splines (B-splines).  A smoothing spline differs from an interpolating
spline in that the resulting curve is not required to pass through each
datapoint.  *Note Interpolation::, for information about interpolating
splines.

   The header file 'gsl_bspline.h' contains the prototypes for the
bspline functions and related declarations.

39.1 Overview
=============

B-splines are commonly used as basis functions to fit smoothing curves
to large data sets.  To do this, the abscissa axis is broken up into
some number of intervals, where the endpoints of each interval are
called "breakpoints".  These breakpoints are then converted to "knots"
by imposing various continuity and smoothness conditions at each
interface.  Given a nondecreasing knot vector t = {t_0, t_1, ...,
t_{n+k-1}}, the n basis splines of order k are defined by

     B_(i,1)(x) = (1, t_i <= x < t_(i+1)
                  (0, else
     B_(i,k)(x) = [(x - t_i)/(t_(i+k-1) - t_i)] B_(i,k-1)(x)
                   + [(t_(i+k) - x)/(t_(i+k) - t_(i+1))] B_(i+1,k-1)(x)

for i = 0, ..., n-1.  The common case of cubic B-splines is given by k =
4.  The above recurrence relation can be evaluated in a numerically
stable way by the de Boor algorithm.

   If we define appropriate knots on an interval [a,b] then the B-spline
basis functions form a complete set on that interval.  Therefore we can
expand a smoothing function as

     f(x) = \sum_i c_i B_(i,k)(x)

given enough (x_j, f(x_j)) data pairs.  The coefficients c_i can be
readily obtained from a least-squares fit.

39.2 Initializing the B-splines solver
======================================

The computation of B-spline functions requires a preallocated workspace
of type 'gsl_bspline_workspace'.  If B-spline derivatives are also
required, an additional 'gsl_bspline_deriv_workspace' is needed.

 -- Function: gsl_bspline_workspace * gsl_bspline_alloc (const size_t K,
          const size_t NBREAK)
     This function allocates a workspace for computing B-splines of
     order K.  The number of breakpoints is given by NBREAK.  This leads
     to n = nbreak + k - 2 basis functions.  Cubic B-splines are
     specified by k = 4.  The size of the workspace is O(5k + nbreak).

 -- Function: void gsl_bspline_free (gsl_bspline_workspace * W)
     This function frees the memory associated with the workspace W.

 -- Function: gsl_bspline_deriv_workspace * gsl_bspline_deriv_alloc
          (const size_t K)
     This function allocates a workspace for computing the derivatives
     of a B-spline basis function of order K.  The size of the workspace
     is O(2k^2).

 -- Function: void gsl_bspline_deriv_free (gsl_bspline_deriv_workspace *
          W)
     This function frees the memory associated with the derivative
     workspace W.

39.3 Constructing the knots vector
==================================

 -- Function: int gsl_bspline_knots (const gsl_vector * BREAKPTS,
          gsl_bspline_workspace * W)
     This function computes the knots associated with the given
     breakpoints and stores them internally in 'w->knots'.

 -- Function: int gsl_bspline_knots_uniform (const double A, const
          double B, gsl_bspline_workspace * W)
     This function assumes uniformly spaced breakpoints on [a,b] and
     constructs the corresponding knot vector using the previously
     specified NBREAK parameter.  The knots are stored in 'w->knots'.

39.4 Evaluation of B-splines
============================

 -- Function: int gsl_bspline_eval (const double X, gsl_vector * B,
          gsl_bspline_workspace * W)
     This function evaluates all B-spline basis functions at the
     position X and stores them in the vector B, so that the i-th
     element is B_i(x).  The vector B must be of length n = nbreak + k -
     2.  This value may also be obtained by calling
     'gsl_bspline_ncoeffs'.  Computing all the basis functions at once
     is more efficient than computing them individually, due to the
     nature of the defining recurrence relation.

 -- Function: int gsl_bspline_eval_nonzero (const double X, gsl_vector *
          BK, size_t * ISTART, size_t * IEND, gsl_bspline_workspace * W)
     This function evaluates all potentially nonzero B-spline basis
     functions at the position X and stores them in the vector BK, so
     that the i-th element is B_(istart+i)(x).  The last element of BK
     is B_(iend)(x).  The vector BK must be of length k.  By returning
     only the nonzero basis functions, this function allows quantities
     involving linear combinations of the B_i(x) to be computed without
     unnecessary terms (such linear combinations occur, for example,
     when evaluating an interpolated function).

 -- Function: size_t gsl_bspline_ncoeffs (gsl_bspline_workspace * W)
     This function returns the number of B-spline coefficients given by
     n = nbreak + k - 2.

39.5 Evaluation of B-spline derivatives
=======================================

 -- Function: int gsl_bspline_deriv_eval (const double X, const size_t
          NDERIV, gsl_matrix * DB, gsl_bspline_workspace * W,
          gsl_bspline_deriv_workspace * DW)
     This function evaluates all B-spline basis function derivatives of
     orders 0 through nderiv (inclusive) at the position X and stores
     them in the matrix DB.  The (i,j)-th element of DB is
     d^jB_i(x)/dx^j.  The matrix DB must be of size n = nbreak + k - 2
     by nderiv + 1.  The value n may also be obtained by calling
     'gsl_bspline_ncoeffs'.  Note that function evaluations are included
     as the zeroth order derivatives in DB.  Computing all the basis
     function derivatives at once is more efficient than computing them
     individually, due to the nature of the defining recurrence
     relation.

 -- Function: int gsl_bspline_deriv_eval_nonzero (const double X, const
          size_t NDERIV, gsl_matrix * DB, size_t * ISTART, size_t *
          IEND, gsl_bspline_workspace * W, gsl_bspline_deriv_workspace *
          DW)
     This function evaluates all potentially nonzero B-spline basis
     function derivatives of orders 0 through nderiv (inclusive) at the
     position X and stores them in the matrix DB.  The (i,j)-th element
     of DB is d^j/dx^j B_(istart+i)(x).  The last row of DB contains
     d^j/dx^j B_(iend)(x).  The matrix DB must be of size k by at least
     nderiv + 1.  Note that function evaluations are included as the
     zeroth order derivatives in DB.  By returning only the nonzero
     basis functions, this function allows quantities involving linear
     combinations of the B_i(x) and their derivatives to be computed
     without unnecessary terms.

39.6 Working with the Greville abscissae
========================================

The Greville abscissae are defined to be the mean location of k-1
consecutive knots in the knot vector for each basis spline function of
order k.  With the first and last knots in the 'gsl_bspline_workspace'
knot vector excluded, there are 'gsl_bspline_ncoeffs' Greville abscissae
for any given B-spline basis.  These values are often used in B-spline
collocation applications and may also be called Marsden-Schoenberg
points.

 -- Function: double gsl_bspline_greville_abscissa (size_t I,
          gsl_bspline_workspace *W);
     Returns the location of the i-th Greville abscissa for the given
     B-spline basis.  For the ill-defined case when k=1, the
     implementation chooses to return breakpoint interval midpoints.

40 Physical Constants
*********************

This chapter describes macros for the values of physical constants, such
as the speed of light, c, and gravitational constant, G.  The values are
available in different unit systems, including the standard MKSA system
(meters, kilograms, seconds, amperes) and the CGSM system (centimeters,
grams, seconds, gauss), which is commonly used in Astronomy.

   The definitions of constants in the MKSA system are available in the
file 'gsl_const_mksa.h'.  The constants in the CGSM system are defined
in 'gsl_const_cgsm.h'.  Dimensionless constants, such as the fine
structure constant, which are pure numbers are defined in
'gsl_const_num.h'.

40.17 Examples
==============

The following program demonstrates the use of the physical constants in
a calculation.  In this case, the goal is to calculate the range of
light-travel times from Earth to Mars.

   The required data is the average distance of each planet from the Sun
in astronomical units (the eccentricities and inclinations of the orbits
will be neglected for the purposes of this calculation).  The average
radius of the orbit of Mars is 1.52 astronomical units, and for the
orbit of Earth it is 1 astronomical unit (by definition).  These values
are combined with the MKSA values of the constants for the speed of
light and the length of an astronomical unit to produce a result for the
shortest and longest light-travel times in seconds.  The figures are
converted into minutes before being displayed.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <gsl/gsl_const_mksa.h>

     int
     main (void)
     {
       double c  = GSL_CONST_MKSA_SPEED_OF_LIGHT;
       double au = GSL_CONST_MKSA_ASTRONOMICAL_UNIT;
       double minutes = GSL_CONST_MKSA_MINUTE;

       /* distance stored in meters */
       double r_earth = 1.00 * au;
       double r_mars  = 1.52 * au;

       double t_min, t_max;

       t_min = (r_mars - r_earth) / c;
       t_max = (r_mars + r_earth) / c;

       printf ("light travel time from Earth to Mars:\n");
       printf ("minimum = %.1f minutes\n", t_min / minutes);
       printf ("maximum = %.1f minutes\n", t_max / minutes);

       return 0;
     }

Here is the output from the program,

     light travel time from Earth to Mars:
     minimum = 4.3 minutes
     maximum = 21.0 minutes

41.1 Representation of floating point numbers
=============================================

The IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic defines binary
formats for single and double precision numbers.  Each number is
composed of three parts: a "sign bit" (s), an "exponent" (E) and a
"fraction" (f).  The numerical value of the combination (s,E,f) is given
by the following formula,

     (-1)^s (1.fffff...) 2^E

The sign bit is either zero or one.  The exponent ranges from a minimum
value E_min to a maximum value E_max depending on the precision.  The
exponent is converted to an unsigned number e, known as the "biased
exponent", for storage by adding a "bias" parameter, e = E + bias.  The
sequence fffff... represents the digits of the binary fraction f.  The
binary digits are stored in "normalized form", by adjusting the exponent
to give a leading digit of 1.  Since the leading digit is always 1 for
normalized numbers it is assumed implicitly and does not have to be
stored.  Numbers smaller than 2^(E_min) are be stored in "denormalized
form" with a leading zero,

     (-1)^s (0.fffff...) 2^(E_min)

This allows gradual underflow down to 2^(E_min - p) for p bits of
precision.  A zero is encoded with the special exponent of 2^(E_min - 1)
and infinities with the exponent of 2^(E_max + 1).

The format for single precision numbers uses 32 bits divided in the
following way,

     seeeeeeeefffffffffffffffffffffff

     s = sign bit, 1 bit
     e = exponent, 8 bits  (E_min=-126, E_max=127, bias=127)
     f = fraction, 23 bits

The format for double precision numbers uses 64 bits divided in the
following way,

     seeeeeeeeeeeffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff

     s = sign bit, 1 bit
     e = exponent, 11 bits  (E_min=-1022, E_max=1023, bias=1023)
     f = fraction, 52 bits

It is often useful to be able to investigate the behavior of a
calculation at the bit-level and the library provides functions for
printing the IEEE representations in a human-readable form.

 -- Function: void gsl_ieee_fprintf_float (FILE * STREAM, const float *
          X)
 -- Function: void gsl_ieee_fprintf_double (FILE * STREAM, const double
          * X)
     These functions output a formatted version of the IEEE
     floating-point number pointed to by X to the stream STREAM.  A
     pointer is used to pass the number indirectly, to avoid any
     undesired promotion from 'float' to 'double'.  The output takes one
     of the following forms,

     'NaN'
          the Not-a-Number symbol

     'Inf, -Inf'
          positive or negative infinity

     '1.fffff...*2^E, -1.fffff...*2^E'
          a normalized floating point number

     '0.fffff...*2^E, -0.fffff...*2^E'
          a denormalized floating point number

     '0, -0'
          positive or negative zero

     The output can be used directly in GNU Emacs Calc mode by preceding
     it with '2#' to indicate binary.

 -- Function: void gsl_ieee_printf_float (const float * X)
 -- Function: void gsl_ieee_printf_double (const double * X)
     These functions output a formatted version of the IEEE
     floating-point number pointed to by X to the stream 'stdout'.

The following program demonstrates the use of the functions by printing
the single and double precision representations of the fraction 1/3.
For comparison the representation of the value promoted from single to
double precision is also printed.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <gsl/gsl_ieee_utils.h>

     int
     main (void)
     {
       float f = 1.0/3.0;
       double d = 1.0/3.0;

       double fd = f; /* promote from float to double */

       printf (" f="); gsl_ieee_printf_float(&f);
       printf ("\n");

       printf ("fd="); gsl_ieee_printf_double(&fd);
       printf ("\n");

       printf (" d="); gsl_ieee_printf_double(&d);
       printf ("\n");

       return 0;
     }

The binary representation of 1/3 is 0.01010101... .  The output below
shows that the IEEE format normalizes this fraction to give a leading
digit of 1,

      f= 1.01010101010101010101011*2^-2
     fd= 1.0101010101010101010101100000000000000000000000000000*2^-2
      d= 1.0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101*2^-2

The output also shows that a single-precision number is promoted to
double-precision by adding zeros in the binary representation.

41.2 Setting up your IEEE environment
=====================================

The IEEE standard defines several "modes" for controlling the behavior
of floating point operations.  These modes specify the important
properties of computer arithmetic: the direction used for rounding (e.g.
whether numbers should be rounded up, down or to the nearest number),
the rounding precision and how the program should handle arithmetic
exceptions, such as division by zero.

   Many of these features can now be controlled via standard functions
such as 'fpsetround', which should be used whenever they are available.
Unfortunately in the past there has been no universal API for
controlling their behavior--each system has had its own low-level way of
accessing them.  To help you write portable programs GSL allows you to
specify modes in a platform-independent way using the environment
variable 'GSL_IEEE_MODE'.  The library then takes care of all the
necessary machine-specific initializations for you when you call the
function 'gsl_ieee_env_setup'.

 -- Function: void gsl_ieee_env_setup ()
     This function reads the environment variable 'GSL_IEEE_MODE' and
     attempts to set up the corresponding specified IEEE modes.  The
     environment variable should be a list of keywords, separated by
     commas, like this,

          'GSL_IEEE_MODE' = "KEYWORD,KEYWORD,..."

     where KEYWORD is one of the following mode-names,

          'single-precision'
          'double-precision'
          'extended-precision'
          'round-to-nearest'
          'round-down'
          'round-up'
          'round-to-zero'
          'mask-all'
          'mask-invalid'
          'mask-denormalized'
          'mask-division-by-zero'
          'mask-overflow'
          'mask-underflow'
          'trap-inexact'
          'trap-common'

     If 'GSL_IEEE_MODE' is empty or undefined then the function returns
     immediately and no attempt is made to change the system's IEEE
     mode.  When the modes from 'GSL_IEEE_MODE' are turned on the
     function prints a short message showing the new settings to remind
     you that the results of the program will be affected.

     If the requested modes are not supported by the platform being used
     then the function calls the error handler and returns an error code
     of 'GSL_EUNSUP'.

     When options are specified using this method, the resulting mode is
     based on a default setting of the highest available precision
     (double precision or extended precision, depending on the platform)
     in round-to-nearest mode, with all exceptions enabled apart from
     the INEXACT exception.  The INEXACT exception is generated whenever
     rounding occurs, so it must generally be disabled in typical
     scientific calculations.  All other floating-point exceptions are
     enabled by default, including underflows and the use of
     denormalized numbers, for safety.  They can be disabled with the
     individual 'mask-' settings or together using 'mask-all'.

     The following adjusted combination of modes is convenient for many
     purposes,

          GSL_IEEE_MODE="double-precision,"\
                          "mask-underflow,"\
                            "mask-denormalized"

     This choice ignores any errors relating to small numbers (either
     denormalized, or underflowing to zero) but traps overflows,
     division by zero and invalid operations.

     Note that on the x86 series of processors this function sets both
     the original x87 mode and the newer MXCSR mode, which controls SSE
     floating-point operations.  The SSE floating-point units do not
     have a precision-control bit, and always work in double-precision.
     The single-precision and extended-precision keywords have no effect
     in this case.

To demonstrate the effects of different rounding modes consider the
following program which computes e, the base of natural logarithms, by
summing a rapidly-decreasing series,

     e = 1 + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + ...
       = 2.71828182846...

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <gsl/gsl_math.h>
     #include <gsl/gsl_ieee_utils.h>

     int
     main (void)
     {
       double x = 1, oldsum = 0, sum = 0;
       int i = 0;

       gsl_ieee_env_setup (); /* read GSL_IEEE_MODE */

       do
         {
           i++;

           oldsum = sum;
           sum += x;
           x = x / i;

           printf ("i=%2d sum=%.18f error=%g\n",
                   i, sum, sum - M_E);

           if (i > 30)
              break;
         }
       while (sum != oldsum);

       return 0;
     }

Here are the results of running the program in 'round-to-nearest' mode.
This is the IEEE default so it isn't really necessary to specify it
here,

     $ GSL_IEEE_MODE="round-to-nearest" ./a.out
     i= 1 sum=1.000000000000000000 error=-1.71828
     i= 2 sum=2.000000000000000000 error=-0.718282
     ....
     i=18 sum=2.718281828459045535 error=4.44089e-16
     i=19 sum=2.718281828459045535 error=4.44089e-16

After nineteen terms the sum converges to within 4 \times 10^-16 of the
correct value.  If we now change the rounding mode to 'round-down' the
final result is less accurate,

     $ GSL_IEEE_MODE="round-down" ./a.out
     i= 1 sum=1.000000000000000000 error=-1.71828
     ....
     i=19 sum=2.718281828459041094 error=-3.9968e-15

The result is about 4 \times 10^-15 below the correct value, an order of
magnitude worse than the result obtained in the 'round-to-nearest' mode.

   If we change to rounding mode to 'round-up' then the final result is
higher than the correct value (when we add each term to the sum the
final result is always rounded up, which increases the sum by at least
one tick until the added term underflows to zero).  To avoid this
problem we would need to use a safer converge criterion, such as 'while
(fabs(sum - oldsum) > epsilon)', with a suitably chosen value of
epsilon.

   Finally we can see the effect of computing the sum using
single-precision rounding, in the default 'round-to-nearest' mode.  In
this case the program thinks it is still using double precision numbers
but the CPU rounds the result of each floating point operation to
single-precision accuracy.  This simulates the effect of writing the
program using single-precision 'float' variables instead of 'double'
variables.  The iteration stops after about half the number of
iterations and the final result is much less accurate,

     $ GSL_IEEE_MODE="single-precision" ./a.out
     ....
     i=12 sum=2.718281984329223633 error=1.5587e-07

with an error of O(10^-7), which corresponds to single precision
accuracy (about 1 part in 10^7).  Continuing the iterations further does
not decrease the error because all the subsequent results are rounded to
the same value.

A.1 Using gdb
=============

Any errors reported by the library are passed to the function
'gsl_error'.  By running your programs under gdb and setting a
breakpoint in this function you can automatically catch any library
errors.  You can add a breakpoint for every session by putting

     break gsl_error

into your '.gdbinit' file in the directory where your program is
started.

   If the breakpoint catches an error then you can use a backtrace
('bt') to see the call-tree, and the arguments which possibly caused the
error.  By moving up into the calling function you can investigate the
values of variables at that point.  Here is an example from the program
'fft/test_trap', which contains the following line,

     status = gsl_fft_complex_wavetable_alloc (0, &complex_wavetable);

The function 'gsl_fft_complex_wavetable_alloc' takes the length of an
FFT as its first argument.  When this line is executed an error will be
generated because the length of an FFT is not allowed to be zero.

   To debug this problem we start 'gdb', using the file '.gdbinit' to
define a breakpoint in 'gsl_error',

     $ gdb test_trap

     GDB is free software and you are welcome to distribute copies
     of it under certain conditions; type "show copying" to see
     the conditions.  There is absolutely no warranty for GDB;
     type "show warranty" for details.  GDB 4.16 (i586-debian-linux),
     Copyright 1996 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

     Breakpoint 1 at 0x8050b1e: file error.c, line 14.

When we run the program this breakpoint catches the error and shows the
reason for it.

     (gdb) run
     Starting program: test_trap

     Breakpoint 1, gsl_error (reason=0x8052b0d
         "length n must be positive integer",
         file=0x8052b04 "c_init.c", line=108, gsl_errno=1)
         at error.c:14
     14        if (gsl_error_handler)

The first argument of 'gsl_error' is always a string describing the
error.  Now we can look at the backtrace to see what caused the problem,

     (gdb) bt
     #0  gsl_error (reason=0x8052b0d
         "length n must be positive integer",
         file=0x8052b04 "c_init.c", line=108, gsl_errno=1)
         at error.c:14
     #1  0x8049376 in gsl_fft_complex_wavetable_alloc (n=0,
         wavetable=0xbffff778) at c_init.c:108
     #2  0x8048a00 in main (argc=1, argv=0xbffff9bc)
         at test_trap.c:94
     #3  0x80488be in ___crt_dummy__ ()

We can see that the error was generated in the function
'gsl_fft_complex_wavetable_alloc' when it was called with an argument of
N=0.  The original call came from line 94 in the file 'test_trap.c'.

   By moving up to the level of the original call we can find the line
that caused the error,

     (gdb) up
     #1  0x8049376 in gsl_fft_complex_wavetable_alloc (n=0,
         wavetable=0xbffff778) at c_init.c:108
     108   GSL_ERROR ("length n must be positive integer", GSL_EDOM);
     (gdb) up
     #2  0x8048a00 in main (argc=1, argv=0xbffff9bc)
         at test_trap.c:94
     94    status = gsl_fft_complex_wavetable_alloc (0,
             &complex_wavetable);

Thus we have found the line that caused the problem.  From this point we
could also print out the values of other variables such as
'complex_wavetable'.

A.2 Examining floating point registers
======================================

The contents of floating point registers can be examined using the
command 'info float' (on supported platforms).

     (gdb) info float

Individual registers can be examined using the variables $REG, where REG
is the register name.

A.3 Handling floating point exceptions
======================================

It is possible to stop the program whenever a 'SIGFPE' floating point
exception occurs.  This can be useful for finding the cause of an
unexpected infinity or 'NaN'.  The current handler settings can be shown
with the command 'info signal SIGFPE'.

     (gdb) info signal SIGFPE
     Signal  Stop  Print  Pass to program Description
     SIGFPE  Yes   Yes    Yes             Arithmetic exception

Unless the program uses a signal handler the default setting should be
changed so that SIGFPE is not passed to the program, as this would cause
it to exit.  The command 'handle SIGFPE stop nopass' prevents this.

     (gdb) handle SIGFPE stop nopass
     Signal  Stop  Print  Pass to program Description
     SIGFPE  Yes   Yes    No              Arithmetic exception

Depending on the platform it may be necessary to instruct the kernel to
generate signals for floating point exceptions.  For programs using GSL
this can be achieved using the 'GSL_IEEE_MODE' environment variable in
conjunction with the function 'gsl_ieee_env_setup' as described in *note
IEEE floating-point arithmetic::.

     (gdb) set env GSL_IEEE_MODE=double-precision

A.4 GCC warning options for numerical programs
==============================================

Writing reliable numerical programs in C requires great care.  The
following GCC warning options are recommended when compiling numerical
programs:

     gcc -ansi -pedantic -Werror -Wall -W
       -Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes
       -Wconversion -Wshadow -Wpointer-arith
       -Wcast-qual -Wcast-align
       -Wwrite-strings -Wnested-externs
       -fshort-enums -fno-common -Dinline= -g -O2

For details of each option consult the manual 'Using and Porting GCC'.
The following table gives a brief explanation of what types of errors
these options catch.

'-ansi -pedantic'
     Use ANSI C, and reject any non-ANSI extensions.  These flags help
     in writing portable programs that will compile on other systems.
'-Werror'
     Consider warnings to be errors, so that compilation stops.  This
     prevents warnings from scrolling off the top of the screen and
     being lost.  You won't be able to compile the program until it is
     completely warning-free.
'-Wall'
     This turns on a set of warnings for common programming problems.
     You need '-Wall', but it is not enough on its own.
'-O2'
     Turn on optimization.  The warnings for uninitialized variables in
     '-Wall' rely on the optimizer to analyze the code.  If there is no
     optimization then these warnings aren't generated.
'-W'
     This turns on some extra warnings not included in '-Wall', such as
     missing return values and comparisons between signed and unsigned
     integers.
'-Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes'
     Warn if there are any missing or inconsistent prototypes.  Without
     prototypes it is harder to detect problems with incorrect
     arguments.
'-Wconversion'
     The main use of this option is to warn about conversions from
     signed to unsigned integers.  For example, 'unsigned int x = -1'.
     If you need to perform such a conversion you can use an explicit
     cast.
'-Wshadow'
     This warns whenever a local variable shadows another local
     variable.  If two variables have the same name then it is a
     potential source of confusion.
'-Wpointer-arith -Wcast-qual -Wcast-align'
     These options warn if you try to do pointer arithmetic for types
     which don't have a size, such as 'void', if you remove a 'const'
     cast from a pointer, or if you cast a pointer to a type which has a
     different size, causing an invalid alignment.
'-Wwrite-strings'
     This option gives string constants a 'const' qualifier so that it
     will be a compile-time error to attempt to overwrite them.
'-fshort-enums'
     This option makes the type of 'enum' as short as possible.
     Normally this makes an 'enum' different from an 'int'.
     Consequently any attempts to assign a pointer-to-int to a
     pointer-to-enum will generate a cast-alignment warning.
'-fno-common'
     This option prevents global variables being simultaneously defined
     in different object files (you get an error at link time).  Such a
     variable should be defined in one file and referred to in other
     files with an 'extern' declaration.
'-Wnested-externs'
     This warns if an 'extern' declaration is encountered within a
     function.
'-Dinline='
     The 'inline' keyword is not part of ANSI C. Thus if you want to use
     '-ansi' with a program which uses inline functions you can use this
     preprocessor definition to remove the 'inline' keywords.
'-g'
     It always makes sense to put debugging symbols in the executable so
     that you can debug it using 'gdb'.  The only effect of debugging
     symbols is to increase the size of the file, and you can use the
     'strip' command to remove them later if necessary.

Appendix C Autoconf Macros
**************************

For applications using 'autoconf' the standard macro 'AC_CHECK_LIB' can
be used to link with GSL automatically from a 'configure' script.  The
library itself depends on the presence of a CBLAS and math library as
well, so these must also be located before linking with the main
'libgsl' file.  The following commands should be placed in the
'configure.ac' file to perform these tests,

     AC_CHECK_LIB([m],[cos])
     AC_CHECK_LIB([gslcblas],[cblas_dgemm])
     AC_CHECK_LIB([gsl],[gsl_blas_dgemm])

It is important to check for 'libm' and 'libgslcblas' before 'libgsl',
otherwise the tests will fail.  Assuming the libraries are found the
output during the configure stage looks like this,

     checking for cos in -lm... yes
     checking for cblas_dgemm in -lgslcblas... yes
     checking for gsl_blas_dgemm in -lgsl... yes

If the library is found then the tests will define the macros
'HAVE_LIBGSL', 'HAVE_LIBGSLCBLAS', 'HAVE_LIBM' and add the options
'-lgsl -lgslcblas -lm' to the variable 'LIBS'.

   The tests above will find any version of the library.  They are
suitable for general use, where the versions of the functions are not
important.  An alternative macro is available in the file 'gsl.m4' to
test for a specific version of the library.  To use this macro simply
add the following line to your 'configure.in' file instead of the tests
above:

     AX_PATH_GSL(GSL_VERSION,
                [action-if-found],
                [action-if-not-found])

The argument 'GSL_VERSION' should be the two or three digit MAJOR.MINOR
or MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO version number of the release you require.  A
suitable choice for 'action-if-not-found' is,

     AC_MSG_ERROR(could not find required version of GSL)

Then you can add the variables 'GSL_LIBS' and 'GSL_CFLAGS' to your
Makefile.am files to obtain the correct compiler flags.  'GSL_LIBS' is
equal to the output of the 'gsl-config --libs' command and 'GSL_CFLAGS'
is equal to 'gsl-config --cflags' command.  For example,

     libfoo_la_LDFLAGS = -lfoo $(GSL_LIBS) -lgslcblas

Note that the macro 'AX_PATH_GSL' needs to use the C compiler so it
should appear in the 'configure.in' file before the macro
'AC_LANG_CPLUSPLUS' for programs that use C++.

   To test for 'inline' the following test should be placed in your
'configure.in' file,

     AC_C_INLINE

     if test "$ac_cv_c_inline" != no ; then
       AC_DEFINE(HAVE_INLINE,1)
       AC_SUBST(HAVE_INLINE)
     fi

and the macro will then be defined in the compilation flags or by
including the file 'config.h' before any library headers.

   The following autoconf test will check for 'extern inline',

     dnl Check for "extern inline", using a modified version
     dnl of the test for AC_C_INLINE from acspecific.mt
     dnl
     AC_CACHE_CHECK([for extern inline], ac_cv_c_extern_inline,
     [ac_cv_c_extern_inline=no
     AC_TRY_COMPILE([extern $ac_cv_c_inline double foo(double x);
     extern $ac_cv_c_inline double foo(double x) { return x+1.0; };
     double foo (double x) { return x + 1.0; };],
     [  foo(1.0)  ],
     [ac_cv_c_extern_inline="yes"])
     ])

     if test "$ac_cv_c_extern_inline" != no ; then
       AC_DEFINE(HAVE_INLINE,1)
       AC_SUBST(HAVE_INLINE)
     fi

   The substitution of portability functions can be made automatically
if you use 'autoconf'.  For example, to test whether the BSD function
'hypot' is available you can include the following line in the configure
file 'configure.in' for your application,

     AC_CHECK_FUNCS(hypot)

and place the following macro definitions in the file 'config.h.in',

     /* Substitute gsl_hypot for missing system hypot */

     #ifndef HAVE_HYPOT
     #define hypot gsl_hypot
     #endif

The application source files can then use the include command '#include
<config.h>' to substitute 'gsl_hypot' for each occurrence of 'hypot'
when 'hypot' is not available.

D.4 Examples
============

The following program computes the product of two matrices using the
Level-3 BLAS function SGEMM,

     [ 0.11 0.12 0.13 ]  [ 1011 1012 ]     [ 367.76 368.12 ]
     [ 0.21 0.22 0.23 ]  [ 1021 1022 ]  =  [ 674.06 674.72 ]
                         [ 1031 1032 ]

The matrices are stored in row major order but could be stored in column
major order if the first argument of the call to 'cblas_sgemm' was
changed to 'CblasColMajor'.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <gsl/gsl_cblas.h>

     int
     main (void)
     {
       int lda = 3;

       float A[] = { 0.11, 0.12, 0.13,
                     0.21, 0.22, 0.23 };

       int ldb = 2;

       float B[] = { 1011, 1012,
                     1021, 1022,
                     1031, 1032 };

       int ldc = 2;

       float C[] = { 0.00, 0.00,
                     0.00, 0.00 };

       /* Compute C = A B */

       cblas_sgemm (CblasRowMajor,
                    CblasNoTrans, CblasNoTrans, 2, 2, 3,
                    1.0, A, lda, B, ldb, 0.0, C, ldc);

       printf ("[ %g, %g\n", C[0], C[1]);
       printf ("  %g, %g ]\n", C[2], C[3]);

       return 0;
     }

To compile the program use the following command line,

     $ gcc -Wall demo.c -lgslcblas

There is no need to link with the main library '-lgsl' in this case as
the CBLAS library is an independent unit.  Here is the output from the
program,

     $ ./a.out
     [ 367.76, 368.12
       674.06, 674.72 ]

GNU General Public License
**************************

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program-to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
====================

  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified
     version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
     that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
     which an implementation is available to the public in source code
     form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities.  However, it does not include the
     work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
     with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
     libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
     its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges
     your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
     copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
     or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
     that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
     material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making
     or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
     behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
     them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
     their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
     limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
          written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
          the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
          you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
          object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
          needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
     a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
     by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
     modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the
     modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation
     of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
     terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
     third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
     for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
     of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
     interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
     efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
     of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
     litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
     alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
     selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
     of it.

  11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor
     version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control"
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
     version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To "grant"
     such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
     commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
     you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
     activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
     grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
     from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
     copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
     those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
     products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
     entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
     prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
     or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
     do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
     cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
     obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
     then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example,
     if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
     further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
     only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
     be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
     number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
===========================

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA 
     OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
     not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify
       this document under the terms of the GNU Free
       Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version
       published by the Free Software Foundation; with no
       Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
       Back-Cover Texts.  A copy of the license is included in
       the section entitled ``GNU Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR
       TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and
       with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
